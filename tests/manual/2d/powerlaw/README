These tests check the accuracy of the power-law solution for
different time step sizes. You can either choose to run all
simulations (default) or a single simulation (axialtraction_powerlaw,
axialtraction_powerlaw_n1, sheartraction_powerlaw). You can also
choose to test the Jacobian; however, this will take much longer
to run. Some examples would be:

Run all tests and check Jacobians:
./run_tests.py --test_jacobians

Run a single test (no Jacobian test):
./run_tests.py --sims axialtraction_powerlaw

Results are displayed in a set of plots.

The jacobian_powerlaw.py script is used to compute the Jacobian for
a power-law material:
./jacobian_powerlaw.py
