Simple tests for coordinate update.

Simple (small) test that just has a tilted upper boundary.
We would expect the boundary to become flat with time.
Note that we are currently printing coordinates and displacements from
fekernels/Elasticity.hh:g0v_grav.

1.  Test with no reference state. This currently runs, but takes many SNES
    iterations (unlike what happened with the initial version). Coordinates
    do change at each time step.
    pylith grav_tilt_surf_norefstate_quad.cfg
2.  Test with reference state. This currently bombs during the first SNES
    iteration due to Inf or Nan.
    pylith grav_tilt_surf_refstate_quad.cfg


Much larger problem with an elastic low density box floating in a higher
density Maxwell viscoelastic material.

1.  Test with no reference state.
    pylith grav_float_box_norefstate_quad.cfg

2.  Test with reference state.
    pylith grav_float_box_refstate_quad.cfg

Right now, the assumption is that the solution should represent displacement
increments. This means that I can't use it directly to update the coordinates
when viewing in Paraview. To do this properly, I use the Python calculator
in Paraview and define a variable called cumulative_displacement, which is
equal to:  numpy.cumsum(displacement, axis=0). I then update the coordinates
using this variable.
