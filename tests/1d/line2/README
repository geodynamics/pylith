AXIAL EXTENSION

1-D axial extension.

Dirichlet boundary conditions
  u(0) = -0.2
  u(4) = +0.2

Analytical solution
  u(x) = -0.2 + 0.1 * x


DISLOCATION

1-D axial extension with dislocation.

Dirichlet boundary conditions (same as extension)
  u(0) = -0.2
  u(4) = +0.2

Dislocation (1-D fault).
  u(2+)-u(2-) = D(2) = 0.5

Analytical solution
  u(x<2) = -0.20 - 0.025 * x
  u(x>2) = +0.30 - 0.025 * x
