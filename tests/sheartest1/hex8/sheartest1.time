# Sample time step group definition file for TECTON.  This file
# contains several integer and real parameters that must be defined
# for each group.  Note that the elastic solution corresponds to
# group number 0 and must always be defined.  Some of the parameters
# have no meaning for the elastic solution but they are defined
# anyway.  In the fortran code, each of the parameters (other than n)
# is stored in a separate array of dimension nintg+1, where nintg
# is the number of time step groups.  The definitions are as follows:
#
#   n      = time step group number.  The elastic solution
#            corresponds to group number 0, and must always be
#            defined.
#   maxstp = the number of steps in the group (this is always 1 for
#            the elastic solution).
#   delt   = time step size.  This is a real value with units of
#            time.
#   alfa   = amount of implicitness.  This is a real dimensionless
#            parameter with values that can range from 0.0 (fully
#            explicit) to 1.0 (fully implicit).  The value is
#            generally set to 0.5.
#   maxit  = maximum number of equilibrium iterations before stiffness 
#            matrix is reformed.
#   ntdinit= number of time steps between initial reformation of
#            stiffness matrix (before any iterations).  A negative
#            value indicates that reformation should occur only once
#            for the first step in the group.  A value of zero indicates
#            that reformation should never occur.
#   lgdef  = large deformation solution flag.  This is an integer
#            parameter with 3 possible values:
#            0:  linear strain
#            1:  large strain, but use only the linear contribution
#                to the stiffness matrix.  This sometimes gives
#                better convergence.
#            2:  large strain using the nonlinear contribution to the
#                stiffness matrix.
#
# Convergence criteria for the nonlinear iterative solution:
#
#   utol   = convergence tolerance for displacements.  This is a
#            dimensionless real value.
#   ftol   = convergence tolerance for forces.  This is a
#            dimensionless real value.
#   etol   = convergence tolerance for energy.  This is a
#            dimensionless real value.
#   itmax  = maximum number of equilibrium iterations.  This is an
#            integer quantity.
#
# Note that the convergence criteria defined below are appropriate for
# a linear elastic problem.  The values would be much different for a
# nonlinear or time-dependent problem.
#
# The only parameter in this list requiring units is the time step
# size, with units of time.  I generally make sure everything is
# converted to seconds, although I frequently specify time in years.
