This test focuses on verifying that PyLith correctly handles spatial
variations in physical properties and updating state variables.

Fault slip is imposed at time t=0 and then the domain undergoes
viscoelastic relaxation with a short relaxation on one side of the
fault (completely relaxes) and a longer relaxation time on the other
side of the fault.
