The tests in this directory involve time-varying displacements applied to a
model consisting of a single cell. The dof are all constrained, so there are
no variables for which to solve.
There are four models:

Plane strain axial displacement problem, displacements either on or off:
pylith planestrain_onecell_2d.cfg cycle_cont2d.cfg

3D simulated plane strain axial displacement problem, displacements either
on or off:
pylith planestrain_onecell_3d.cfg cycle_cont3d.cfg

Plane strain axial displacement problem, sinusoidal displacements over
multiple cycles.
pylith planestrain_onecell_2d.cfg cycle_sin2d.cfg

3D simulated plane strain axial displacement problem, sinusoidal
displacements over multiple cycles.
pylith planestrain_onecell_3d.cfg cycle_sin3d.cfg

To run all of the simulations, use the run-models.sh script.

The 2D and 3D problems should yield the same displacements, strains,
stresses, and plastic strains when the appropriate components are compared.
