The tests in this directory involve displacement BC applied in the elastic
solution. There are then 10 time steps to allow plastic yield. There should
be no additional yield after the first time step. If there is, either
something didn't converge or there's a problem with the simulation setup or
with the plastic solution.
There are eight models:

Plane strain axial displacement problem, two cells.
pylith planestrain_twocells_2d.cfg axialdisp_twocells_2d.cfg

3D simulated plane strain axial displacement problem, two cells.
pylith planestrain_twocells_3d.cfg axialdisp_twocells_3d.cfg

Plane strain shear displacement problem, two cells.
pylith planestrain_twocells_2d.cfg sheardisp_twocells_2d.cfg

3D simulated plane strain shear displacement problem, two cells.
pylith planestrain_twocells_3d.cfg sheardisp_twocells_3d.cfg

Plane strain axial displacement problem, full mesh.
pylith planestrain_fine_2d.cfg axialdisp_fine_2d.cfg

3D simulated plane strain axial displacement problem, full mesh.
pylith planestrain_fine_3d.cfg axialdisp_fine_3d.cfg

Plane strain shear displacement problem, full mesh.
pylith planestrain_fine_2d.cfg sheardisp_fine_2d.cfg

3D simulated plane strain shear displacement problem, full mesh.
pylith planestrain_fine_3d.cfg sheardisp_fine_3d.cfg

To run all of the simulations, use the run-models.sh script.

The 2D and 3D problems should yield the same displacements, strains,
stresses, and plastic strains when the appropriate components are compared.
