# Preface

This documentation is aimed at two categories of users: (1) scientists who prefer to use prepackaged and specialized analysis tools, and (2) experienced computational Earth scientists.
If you want to modify the source code, you will likely need to be familiar with object-oriented programming, Python and C++, and finite-element analysis.

## Citation

The Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG) ([geodynamics.org](https://geodynamics.org/)) is making this software and source code available to you at no cost in hopes that the software will enhance your research in geophysics.
A number of individuals have contributed a significant portion of their careers toward the development of this software.
It is essential that you recognize these individuals in the normal scientific practice by citing the appropriate peer-reviewed papers and making appropriate acknowledgments in talks and publications.
The preferred way to generate the list of publications (in BibTeX format) to cite is to run your simulations with the `--include-citations` command line argument, or equivalently, the `--petsc.citations` command line argument.
The `--help-citations` command line argument will generate the BibTeX entries for the references mentioned below.

The following peer-reviewed paper discussed the development of PyLith:
