# PETSc Finite-Element Implementation

Formulating the weak form of the governing equation in terms of pointwise functions allows the PyLith implementation of the equations to be done at a rather high level.
Most of the finite-element details are encapsulated in PETSc routines that compute the integrals and solve the system of equations.
In fact, adding materials and boundary conditions requires calling only a few PETSc finite-element functions to register the point-wise functions.
A new material may need to add to the library of solution subfields and auxiliary subfields, but adding these fields is also done at a high-level.

The remainder of this section discusses three aspects of the finite-element implementation handled by PyLith to give you a peek of what is going on under the hood.
Refer to the {ref}`cha:glossary` for definitions of the terminology.

## DMPlex

The finite-element mesh is stored as a `DMPlex` object.
This is a particular implementation of the PETSc Data Management (`DM`, called `PetscDM` within PyLith) object.
Within a `DMPlex` object, vertices, edges, faces, and cells are all called points.
The points are numbered sequentially, beginning with cells, followed by vertices, edges, and then faces.
Treating all topological pieces of the mesh the same way, as points in an abstract graph, allows us to write algorithms which apply to very different meshes without change.
For example, we can write a finite element assembly loop that applies to meshes of any dimension, with any cell shape, with (almost) any finite element.

### Point Depth and Height

In general, vertices are at a _depth_ of 0 and cells are at the maximum depth.
Similarly, cells are at a _height_ of 0 and vertices are at the maximum height.
Notice that depth and height correspond to the usual dimension and codimension.
{numref}`tab-developer-plex-depth-height` shows the heights and depths of the vertices edges, faces, and cells in a 3D mesh.


```{table} Depth and height of various topological pieces in DMPlex.
:name: tab-developer-plex-depth-height
| Point type | Depth | Height |
| :--------- | :---: | :----: |
| Vertices   |   0   |   3    |
| Edges      |   1   |   2    |
| Faces      |   2   |   1    |
| Cells      |   3   |   0    |
```

For a boundary mesh, we currently store the full set of points (vertices, edges, faces, and cells).
Obviously for 2-D meshes, the boundary mesh doesn't contain "volume" cells, but just vertices, edges, and faces.
This means the "boundary" cells are at a height of 1 and a depth equal to the maximum depth of 1.

## `PetscSection` and `PetscVec`

We store a field over the mesh in a vector (PETSc `Vec` object, called `PetscVec` in PyLith).
The `PetscSection` object describes the layout of the vector over the DMPlex object.
The vector may hold multiple subfields, each with its own discretization.
The chart of the `PetscSection` defines the range of points (minimum and maximum) over which the section is defined.
For each point in the chart, the section holds the number of degrees of freedom a point has and the offset in the `PetscVec` for its first degree of freedom.
The section also holds the number of degrees of freedom and offset for each individual subfield within the section for each point in the chart.

Because the `PetscSection` knows only about points, and not about topology or geometry, it allows us to express the mathematical concepts without getting lost in the details.
For example, a $P_1$ 3D vector field assigns 3 degrees of freedom to each vertex.
This same section could be used to layout a field over a circle, surface of a cylinder, Mobius strip, sphere, cube, ball, or PyLith mesh.
The section separates the layout of data over a mesh from the actual storage of values, which is done by the `PetscVec`.
The section tells you how to look up the values, which are associated with a piece of the mesh, inside the vector.
For example, you can ask for the offset into the vector for the values associated with an edge in the mesh, and how many degrees of freedom there are on the edge.

The `PetscSection` also includes the information about the constrained degrees of freedom.
We refer to a `PetscVec` that includes the values for the constrained degrees of freedom as a _local_ vector and a `PetscVec` with the values for the constrained degrees of freedom removed as a _global_ vector.
Constraints often arise from Dirichlet boundary conditions, which change the basis functions of the approximating space, but can also arise from algebraic relations between unknowns.
A local vector is used for assembly of the residual vector and Jacobian matrix, because we need the boundary values in order to compute those integrals.
Global vectors are used for the algebraic solver because we do not want solution values fixed by constraints to participate in the solve.

# This example solution field has three subfields:
#   * displacement (vector field, 2 components, basis order 1)
#   * velocity (vector field, 2 components, basis order 1)
#   * pressure (scalar field, 1 component, basis order 0)
#
# The displacement and velocity subfields have degrees of freedom on the vertices.
# The pressure subfield has degrees of freedom on the cells.
#
# The order of the values (offsets in the PetscVec) follows the
# ordering of the points (cells, vertices, edges, and faces).
# In this example, the pressure subfield appears first (offsets 0-3),
# followed by the two components of the displacement subfield and
# velocity subfield for each point.

## Integration

Integration involves integrals over the domain (materials), over the boundary of the domain (boundary conditions), or over interior interfaces (fault surface).
These three operations are done by different PETSc functions and integrator objects.

`DMPlexComputeResidual_Internal`
: Compute the contribution to the LHS or RHS residual for a single material.
This function and the functions it calls handle looping over the cells in the material, integrating the weak form for each of the fields, and adding them to the residual.
A more appropriate name would be `DMPlexComputeResidualSingle`, and that may be used in the future.
This function is called from `IntegratorDomain`.

`DMPlexComputeBdResidualSingle`
: Compute the contribution to the LHS or RHS residual for a single boundary condition.
This function and the functions it calls handle looping over faces (3D) or edges (2D) on the boundary, integrating the weak form for each of the fields, and adding them to the residual.
This function is called from `IntegratorBoundary`.

`DMPlexComputeResidual_Hybrid_Internal`
: Compute the contribution to the LHS or RHS residual for a single fault surface.
This function and the functions it calls handle looping over the cohesive cells , integrating the weak form for each of the fields, and adding them to the residual.
This function is called from `IntegratorInterface`.

## Projection

Input and output often involve projecting fields to/from the finite-element space.
PETSc provides a family of functions for this.
We generally use two of these, one for analytical functions and one for discretized fields.
Projection may be a misleading term here, since we are not referring to the common $L_2$ projection, but rather interpolation of the function by functions in our finite-element space.

Let's start with the simple example of Fourier analysis, which most people have experience with.
If we want the Fourier interpolant $\tilde f$ for a given function $f$, then we need to determine its Fourier coefficients, $f_k$, where
\begin{equation}
  \tilde f = \sum_k f_k e^{i k x}.
\end{equation}

This is straightforward because the basis functions in the Fourier representation are orthogonal,
\begin{equation}
  \int^{2\pi}_0 e^{-i m x} e^{i k x} \, dx = 2\pi \delta_{km}.
\end{equation}
To find the coefficient $f_m$, we just multiply by the conjugate of the basis function and integrate,
\begin{align}
  \int^{2\pi}_0 e^{-i m x} \tilde f \, dx &= \int^{2\pi}_0 e^{-i m x} \sum_k f_k e^{i k x} \, dx, \\
                                  &= \sum_k f_k \int^{2\pi}_0 e^{-i m x} e^{i k x} \, dx, \\
                                  &= \sum_k f_k 2\pi \delta_{km}, \\
  &= 2\pi f_m,
\end{align}
and we have our coefficient $f_m$,
\begin{equation}
  f_m = \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int^{2\pi}_0 e^{-i m x} \tilde f \, dx.
\end{equation}

The finite element basis $\phi_i$ is not orthogonal, so we have an extra step.
We could take the inner product of $f$ with all the basis functions, and then sort out the dependencies by solving a linear system (the mass matrix), which is what happens in $L_2$
projection.
However, suppose we have another basis $\psi_i$ of linear functionals which is _biorthogonal_ to $\phi_i$, meaning
\begin{equation}
  \psi_i(\phi_j) = \delta_{ij}.
\end{equation}
We can easily pick out the coefficient of $\tilde f$ by acting with the corresponding basis functional.
Our interpolant is
\begin{equation}
  \tilde f = \sum_k f_k \phi_k(x).
\end{equation}
Acting on the interpolant with the biorthogonal basis results in
\begin{equation}
  \psi_i(\tilde f) = \psi_i\left( \sum_k f_k \phi_k(x) \right).
\end{equation}
Making use of the fact that the finite-element basis $\phi_i$ is linear, yields
\begin{align}
  \psi_i(\tilde f) &= \sum_k f_k \psi_i\left( \phi_k(x) \right),\\
  \psi_i(\tilde f) &= \sum_k f_k \delta_{ik}, \\
  \psi_i(\tilde f) &= f_i.
\end{align}
We call $\phi_i$ the _primal_ basis, and $\psi_i$ the _dual_ basis.
We note that if $f$ does not lie in our approximation space spanned by $\phi_i$, then interpolation is not equivalent to $L_2$ projection.
This will not usually be important for our purposes.

`DMProjectFunctionLocal`
: Project an analytical function into the given finite-element space.

`DMProjectFieldLocal`
: Project a discretized field in one finite-element space into another finite-element space.

## Pointwise functions (kernels)

The following code blocks show the function prototypes for pointwise functions for the residual and the Jacobian.
We use the same prototype for the boundary and fault interfaces residuals.

The integrators handle calling the appropriate functions for setting the kernels for the integration.
The `Physics` objects (materials, boundary conditions, and faults) tell the integrators what kernels to use.
Pointwise functions not used should be set to `NULL`.
