# Documentation

We write the PyLith documentation in Markedly Structured Text (a Markdown version of reStructured Text) and generate the manual using Sphinx.
The manual is automatically built for the `main` branch and posted at <https://pylith.readthedocs.io>.

## Contributing to the documentation

In browsing the HTML documentation there is a one to one correspondence between an HTML page and its Markdown page.
You can look at the URL of the HTML page and the corresponding Markdown page will be in the `docs` directory with the `.html` suffix replaced by `.md`.
