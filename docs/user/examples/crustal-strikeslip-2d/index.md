## Overview

This suite of examples demonstrates using PyLith to model multiple intersecting faults embedded in a 2D georeferenced domain ({numref}`fig:example:crustal:strikeslip:2d:overview`).
The geometry is based on the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence.

:Step 1: Static uniform coseismic slip with Dirichlet (displacement) boundary conditions.
:Step 2: Static spatially varying coseismic slip with Dirichlet (displacement) boundary conditions.

Diagram of geometry for the domain with three intersecting strike-slip faults.
The domain extends from 80 km in the east-west direction and 80 km in the north-south direction.
We refer to the domain boundaries using the names shown in the diagram.

:::{important}
We describe how to generate the finite-element mesh using both Gmsh and Cubit.
For Step 1 we provide PyLith parameter files for both meshes; for Step 2 we only provide the parameter files that use the Gmsh file.
