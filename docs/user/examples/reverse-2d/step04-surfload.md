# Step 4: Surface Tractions

% Metadata extracted from parameter files.
```{include} step04a_surfload-synopsis.md
```

This example focuses on loading via surface tractions on the +y boundary.
We apply tractions normal to the boundary with a trapezoidal distribution as shown in {numref}`fig:example:reverse:2d:step04:diagram`.
We use the same roller boundary conditions that we used in Steps 1-3.

:::{figure-md} fig:example:reverse:2d:step04:diagram
<img src="figs/step04-diagram.*" alt="" scale="75%">

We add a Neumann (traction) boundary condition on the +y boundary with roller boundary conditions on the lateral sides and bottom of the domain.

## Step 4a: Coarse Mesh

:::{note}
*New in v4.1.0.*

We start with a coarse resolution mesh that captures the geometry and increase the resolution of the simulation by using uniform refinement or increasing the basis order of the solution fields.

### Visualizing the results

In {numref}`fig:example:reverse:2d:step04a:solution` and {numref}`fig:example:reverse:2d:step04a:stress` we use the `pylith_viz` utility to visualize the simulation results.

## Step 4b: Refined Mesh

As in Step 1, we try to improve on the accuracy of the solution by refining the mesh.

### Simulation parameters

## Step 4c: Higher Order Discretization

As in Step 1, we again use a higher order discretization of the solution field to improve the accuracy of the model.

### Simulation parameters

The parameters specific to this example are in `step04c_surfload.cfg`.

```{code-block} cfg
---
caption: Parameters for using higher order discretization in Step 4c.
---
[pylithapp.problem]
defaults.quadrature_order = 2

[pylithapp.problem.solution.subfields.displacement]
basis_order = 2

[pylithapp.problem.materials.slab]
derived_subfields.cauchy_strain.basis_order = 1
derived_subfields.cauchy_stress.basis_order = 1

[pylithapp.problem.materials.crust]
derived_subfields.cauchy_strain.basis_order = 1

derived_subfields.cauchy_stress.basis_order = 1
```

## Key Points

1. The displacement field is very similar for the three different discretizations.
2. This stress field, especially the shear stress component, is not well resolved with a basis order of 1 and the coarse mesh.
3. Refining the mesh to decrease the discretization size by a factor of two yields better resolution of the shear stress field.
4. Using a basis order of 2 with the coarse mesh provides better resolution of the stress concentration compared with refining the mesh.
5. When resolving the stress field components is important, you will likely want to use a basis ordre of 2 for the displacement solution subfield.
