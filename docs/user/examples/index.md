# Examples

## Overview

This section includes several suites of examples available in the `examples` directory.
Each suite includes several "steps" which are examples that increase in complexity from one "step" to the next.
In some cases, a later step may make use of output from an earlier step; these cases are clearly documented.
{numref}`tab:examples:overview` classifies the level of difficulty of each example suite and provides a general description of the type of problems discussed.

```{table} Overview of example suites.
:name: tab:examples:overview

| **Example Suite**                         | **Difficulty** | **Description** |
|:------------------------------------------|:------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`box-2d`](box-2d/index.md)               | novice       | Simple axial and shear deformation in static and quasi-static simulations in 2D box with a mesh in an ASCII text file.
| [`box-3d`](box-3d/index.md)               | novice       | Same as `2d/box` but with a 3D box and a mesh from Gmsh or Cubit.
| [`strikeslip-2d`](strikeslip-2d/index.md) | beginner     | Prescribed coseismic slip and multiple earthquake ruptures in 2D with a mesh from Gmsh or Cubit.
| [`reverse-2d`](reverse-2d/index.md)       | beginner     | Gravity, surface loads, and prescribed coseismic slip on multiple reverse faults in 2D with a mesh from Gmsh or Cubit.
| [`subduction-2d`](subduction-2d/index.md) | intermediate | Coseismic, postseismic, and creep deformation using a 2D subduction zone cross-section with a mesh from Gmsh or Cubit.
| [`subduction-3d`](subduction-3d/index.md) | intermediate | Close to research-complexity for a 3D subduction zone with a mesh from Cubit.
| [`magma-2d`](magma-2d/index.md) | intermediate | Magma reservoir using poroelasticity.
| [`troubleshooting-2d`](troubleshooting-2d/index.md) | novice | Troubleshooting errors in simulation in put files.
```

The `subduction-3d` example suite is the most advanced.
Users wanting to use PyLith in their research should work through relevant beginner examples and then the `subduction-3d` examples.

:::{tip}
You can use the `pylith_cfgsearch` utility (see {ref}`sec-user-run-pylith-utilities`) to search for examples based on keywords and features.
:::

### Prerequisites

Before you begin any of the examples, you will need to install PyLith following the instructions in {ref}`sec-install`.
You should also read {ref}`sec-user-run-pylith`.
Complete sets of input files are included in the examples.
However, if you wish to generate the finite-element meshes yourself, you will also need Gmsh (available from <https://gmsh.info> and included in the PyLith binary package), Coreform Cubit (available from <https://coreform.com/>), CUBIT (available to US federal government agencies from <https://cubit.sandia.gov/>) or LaGriT (available from <https://meshing.lanl.gov/>).
The ParaView <https://www.paraview.org/> visualization package may be used to view simulation results.
ParaView includes built-in documentation that is accessed by clicking on the Help menu item.
Some additional documentation is available on the ParaView Wiki site <https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView>.
You may use other visualization software, but some adaption from what is described here will be necessary.

### Input Files

The files needed to work through the examples are found in the `examples` directory under the top-level PyLith directory.
All of the files used in the example problems are extensively documented with comments.

### Visualizing PyLith Output

See [ParaView Python Scripts](paraview-python.md) for a description of how to make use of the provided Python scripts for visualizing simulation output with ParaView.
Alternatively, you can manually construct the visuzliation pipeline in several open-source visualization tools, such as ParaView and Visit.
