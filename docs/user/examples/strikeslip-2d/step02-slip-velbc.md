## Simulation parameters

This example involves a quasi-static simulation that solves for the deformation from velocity boundary conditions and prescribed coseismic slip on the fault.
We let strain accumulate due to the motion of the boundaries and then release the strain by prescribing 2 meters of right-lateral slip at t=100 years.
{numref}`fig:example:strikeslip:2d:step02:diagram` shows the boundary conditions on the domain.
The parameters specific to this example are in `step02_slip_velbc.cfg`.

Boundary conditions for quasistatic simulation with velocity boundary conditions and coseismic slip.
We set the x displacement to zero on the +x and -x boundaries.
We set the y velocity to -1 cm/yr on the +x boundary and +1 cm/yr on the -x boundary.
We prescribe 2 meters of right-lateral slip to occur at 100 years to release the accumulated strain energy.

### Boundary conditions

We switch the Dirichlet boundary conditions from specifying an initial amplitude to specifying a constant velocity,
\begin{align}
\dot{u}_x(-50km,y) &= 0,\\
\dot{u}_y(-50km,y) &= +1 cm/yr,\\
\dot{u}_x(+50km,y) &= 0,\\
\dot{u}_y(+50km,y) &= -1 cm/yr.
\end{align}

As in Step 1 we prescribe 2.0 meters of right-lateral slip, but in this case we set slip to occur at t=100 years.

$ pylith step02_slip_velbc.cfg

# The output should look something like the following.

The beginning of the output written to the terminal is identical to that from Step 1.
At the end of the output, we see that the simulation advanced the solution 25 time steps.
Remember that the PETSc TS monitor shows the nondimensionalized time and time step values.

## Visualizing the results

In {numref}`fig:example:strikeslip:2d:step02:solution` we use the `pylith_viz` utility to visualize the y displacement field.
You can move the slider or use the `p` and `n` keys to change the increment or decrement time.

Solution for Step 2 at t=100 yr.
The colors of the shaded surface indicate the y displacement, and the deformation is exaggerated by a factor of 1000.
The undeformed configuration is shown by the gray wireframe.
The coseismic fault slip at 100 years releases all of the accumulated strain energy.
