# Step 4: Variable Coseismic Slip

% Metadata extracted from parameter files.
```{include} step04_varslip-synopsis.md

## Simulation parameters

We use this example to illustrate prescribing slip that varies along the strike of the fault.
This example also serves as a means to generate coseismic displacements at fake GPS stations.
In Step 6 we will use the displacements at these stations along with static Green's functions computed in Step 5 to invert for the slip on the fault.

We prescribe left-lateral slip that varies along the strike of the fault with fixed displacements on the +x and -x boundaries ({numref}`fig:example:strikeslip:2d:step04:diagram`), similar to what we had in Step 1.
The slip is nonzero over the region -20 km $\le$ y $\le$ +20 km with a peak slip of 80 cm at y=-0.5 km ({numref}`fig:example:strikeslip:2d:step04:slip`).

This example involves a static simulation that solves for the deformation from prescribed coseismic slip on the fault.
{numref}`fig:example:strikeslip:2d:step04:diagram` shows the boundary conditions on the domain.
The parameters specific to this example are in `step04_varslip.cfg`.

Boundary conditions for static coseismic slip.
We set the x and y displacement to zero on the +x and -x boundaries and prescribe left-lateral slip that varies along strike.
:::

We increase the basis order of the solution subfields to 2 to better resolve the spatial variation in slip.
We also add output of the solution at fake GPS stations given in the file `gps_stations.txt`.
You can use the Python script `generate_gpsstations.py` to generate a different random set of stations; the default parameters will generate the provided `gps_stations.txt` file.

The earthquake rupture occurs along the central portion of the fault with spatially variable slip.

Prescribed left-lateral slip that varies along the strike of the fault.
A strike of 0 corresponds to y=0.

We use a `SimpleDB` to define the spatial variation in slip.

The beginning of the output written to the terminal matches that in our previous simulations.
At the end of the output written to the terminal, we see that the solver advanced the solution one time step (static simulation).
The linear solve converged after 73 iterations and the norm of the residual met the absolute convergence tolerance (`ksp_atol`).
The nonlinear solve converged in 1 iteration, which we expect because this is a linear problem, and the residual met the absolute convergence tolerance (`snes_atol`).

## Visualizing the results

The `output` directory contains the simulation output.
Each "observer" writes its own set of files, so the solution over the domain is in one set of files, the boundary condition information is in another set of files, and the material information is in yet another set of files.
The HDF5 (`.h5`) files contain the mesh geometry and topology information along with the solution fields.
The Xdmf (`.xmf`) files contain metadata that allow visualization tools like ParaView to know where to find the information in the HDF5 files.
To visualize the data using ParaView or Visit, load the Xdmf files.

In {numref}`fig:example:strikeslip:2d:step04:solution` we use ParaView to visualize the y displacement field using the `viz/plot_dispwarp.py` Python script.
As in Steps 2-3 we override the default name of the simulation file with the name of the current simulation.

```{code-block} python
---
caption: Set the simulation in the ParaView Python Shell.

>>> SIM = "step04_varslip"
```

Next we run the `viz/plot_dispwarp.py` Python script as described in {ref}`sec-paraview-python-scripts`.
We can add the displacement vectors at the fake GPS stations using the `viz/plot_dispstations.py` Python script.

Solution for Step 4.
The colors of the shaded surface indicate the magnitude of the y displacement, and the deformation is exaggerated by a factor of 1000.
The displacement vectors at the fake GPS stations use en exaggeration factor of 50,000.
