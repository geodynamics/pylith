## Overview

This suite of examples demonstrates use of a wide variety of features and the general workflow often used in research simulations.
We base the model on the Cascadia subduction zone ({numref}`fig:example:subduction:3d:cascadia`).
These examples focus on modeling the deformation associated with the the subducting slab, including interseismic deformation with aseismic slip (creep) and viscoelastic relaxation, coseismic slip on the slab interface and a splay fault, and slow slip events on the subduction interface.
We account for the 3D material properties associated with different elastic properties for the subducting slab, mantle, continental crust, and accretionary wedge.
To keep the computation time in these examples short, we limit our model to an 800 km $\times$ 800 km $\times$ 400 km domain and we use a relatively coarse discretization.
For simplicity and to reduce complexity in constructing the mesh, we use a flat top surface (elevation of 0 with respect to mean sea level).

{numref}`fig:example:subduction:3d:concept` shows our conceptual model with a slab, mantle, continental crust, and accretionary wedge.
We cut off the slab at a depth of 100 km.
We use a transverse geographic projection coordinate system with Portland, Oregon, as the origin to georeference our model.
To model the motion of the slab, we include a fault for the subduction interface (the interface between the top of the slab and the mantle, crust, and wedge), as well as a fault between the bottom of the slab and the mantle.

:Step 1: Static axial compression.
:Step 2: Quasi-static coseismic and postseismic deformation from an earthquake rupture in the center of the subduction zone interface.
:Step 3: Quasi-static interseisic deformation with creep on the top and bottom of the slab.
:Step 4: Quasi-static earthquake cycle with prescribed earthquake rupture and creep.
:Step 5: Spontaneous rupture driven by subducting slab.
:Step 6: Prescribed slow-slip event.
:Step 7a,b: Generation of 3D Green's functions and inversion of displacements for slow slip event from Step 6.
:Step 8a,b,c: Stress field due to gravitational body forces.

:::{warning}
Steps 5 and 8c have not yet been updated for PyLith v3+.

:::{danger}
These simulations are significantly larger than those for the other suites of examples.
Some of the time-dependent simulations may take 30 minutes or more to run and use up to 4 GB of memory.
We are working to select better preconditioners to improve the solvers and reduce the runtime.
