# Step 6: Slip on Two Faults

In this example we include coseismic prescribed slip on both the main and splay faults.
We specify 2 meters of reverse slip on the main fault and 1 meter of reverse slip on the splay fault.
{numref}`fig:example:troubleshooting:2d:step06:diagram` shows the boundary conditions on the domain.
The parameters specific to this example are in `step06_twofaults.cfg`.

Boundary conditions for static coseismic slip on both the main and splay faults.
We prescribe 2 meters of reverse slip on the main fault with 1 meter of reverse slip on the splay fauult.
We use roller boundary conditions on the lateral sides and bottom of the domain.
