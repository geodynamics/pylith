# Step 4: Shear Displacement and Initial Conditions

## Simulation parameters

In this example we demonstrate the use of initial conditions for the boundary value problem in Step 2.
We set the displacement field over the domain to the analytical solutin as an initial condition.

The parameters specific to this example are in `step04_sheardispic.cfg`.
The only difference with respect to Step 2 is the addition of the initial condition.
From our boundary conditions we can see that the analytical solution to our boundary value problem is $\vec{u}(x,y,z)=(ay,ax,0)$.
Because we are specifying the displacement field over the domain, we use the `SimpleGridDB`, which specifies the values on a logically rectangular grid aligned with the coordinate axes.
The grid layout of the values allows queries for values at points to be much more efficient than a `SimpleDB` which can have points at arbitrary locations.

ic.domain = pylith.problems.InitialConditionDomain

[pylithapp.problem.ic.domain]
db = spatialdata.spatialdb.SimpleGridDB
db.description = Initial conditions over domain
db.filename = sheardisp_ic.spatialdb
db.query_type = linear
```

WARNING! There are options you set that were not used!
WARNING! could be spelling mistake, etc!
There are 2 unused database options. They are:
Option left: name:-mg_fine_ksp_max_it value: 5 source: code
Option left: name:-mg_levels_pc_type value: pbjacobi source: code
```

By design we set the initial condition so that it satisfies the elasticity equation.
As a result, the first nonlinear solver residual evaluation meets the convergence criteria.
The linear solver is not used; this is why PETSc reports an unused option at the end of the simulation.

## Visualizing the results

In {numref}`fig:example:box:3d:step04:solution` we use the `pylith_viz` utility to visualize the x displacement field.

Solution for Step 4.
The colors of the shaded surface indicate the x displacement, and the deformation is exaggerated by a factor of 1000.
The undeformed configuration is shown by the gray wireframe.
THe solution matches the one in Step 2.
