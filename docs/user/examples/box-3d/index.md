# Axial and Shear Deformation (3D Box)

This example is the 3D version of the 2D box axial shear and deformation example (`examples/box-2d`).
The files are in the directory `examples/box-3d` and include:

:`README.md`: README file containing a brief description of the various examples.
:`*.cfg`: PyLith parameter files.
:`generate_gmsh.py`: Python script to generate the finite-element mesh using Gmsh.
:`generate_cubit.py`: Python script to generate the finite-element mesh using Cubit.
:`*.msh`: Gmsh finite-element mesh files generated by Gmsh.
:`*.exo`: Exodus II finite-element mesh files generated by Cubit.
:`*.spatialdb`: Spatial database filesFiles associated with the spatial databases.
:`output`: Directory containing simulation output. It is created automatically when running the simulations.

## Overview

This suite of examples demonstrates some basic concepts of using PyLith to solve the static and quasistatic boundary elasticity equation in a 3D box ({numref}`fig:example:box:3d:overview`) with uniform material properties.
The examples incrementally add complexity through a series of steps:

:Step 1: Axial extension with Dirichlet (displacement) boundary conditions.
:Step 2: Shear deformation with Dirichlet (displacement) boundary conditions.
:Step 3: Shear deformation with Dirichlet (displacement) and Neumann (traction) boundary conditions.
:Step 4: Same as Step 2 but with initial conditions equal to the analytical solution.
:Step 5: Shear deformation with time-dependent Dirichlet (displacement) and Neumann (traction) boundary conditions.
