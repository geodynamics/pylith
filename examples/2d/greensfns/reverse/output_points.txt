# This file contains a list of points where we want the solution. The
# solution will be interpolated to these points, so they need not
# coincide with vertices of the mesh.
#
# We specify the coordinates in the default coordinate system (2-D
# Cartesian). To specify points in another coordinate system, use the
# coordsys component of the OutputSolnPoints object. The points will
# be transformed into the coordinate system of the mesh before
# interpolation.
