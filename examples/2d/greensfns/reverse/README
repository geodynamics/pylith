The example in this directory demonstrates the use of computing static
Green's functions using PyLith and using them in a simple inversion
for slip on a reverse fault.

The main features of this example are:

  * Generating a finite-element mesh using CUBIT
    + Variable mesh resolution
  * Spatially variable slip
  * Computing Green's functions using PyLith

The examples consists of two simulations. In the first simulation we
compute the displacements due to a variable slip on a reverse
fault (idealized in a 2-D model with plane-strain); this serves as the
"observed" displacements. In the second simulation we compute Green's
functions for the fault. We use these Green's functions in the second
simulation and the observed displacements from the first simulation to
invert for the slip (in the first simulation).

The imposed slip in the first simulation includes a region of uniform
slip with a linear taper at each end. We use uniform linear elastic
properties with a plane-strain formulation.

The parameters for the bulk constitutive models are defined in
  mat_elastic.spatialdb

The simulation will output the displacements on the ground surface as
well as a selection of points (defined in output_points.txt).

For each of the simulations, we recommend examining the displacements,
stress field, and fault slip. 


Mesh generation (optional)

  NOTE: The result of this step will overwrite the included file
        tri3_mesh.exo. You may want to copy/rename this file so that
        you have a backup copy in case you have difficulty running
        CUBIT.

  Start CUBIT and play the journal file "mesh_tri3.jou". We highly
  recommend that you study the contents of the journal files to
  understand the mesh generation process.


Step 1. Forward simulation

  This simulation mimics an earthquake generating an observed
  displacement field.

  The parameters for the earthquake slip are defined in
    eqslip.spatialdb

  Run the simulation via the following command:
    pylith eqsim.cfg.


Step 2. Generate Green's functions

  This simulation generates Green's functions for a subset of the fault.

  The parameters for the amplitude (and sign) of the slip impulses are
  defined in
    impulse_amplitude.spatialdb

  Run the simulation via the following command:
    pylith --problem=pylith.problems.GreensFns


Step 3. Invert for coseismic slip

Suggestions variations

  The list below includes some suggested modifications to the problem
  that will allow you to become more familiar with PyLith while
  examining some interesting physics.

  * Create a spatial variation in material properties. For example you
    might create a velocity contrast across the fault.

  * Adjust the slip distribution.

  * Adjust the location and number of the observation points.

  * Increase/decrease the resolution of the mesh.
