This directory contains a set of three elastic plane strain example
problems. All problems share the same mesh and material properties,
with the only differences being in the boundary conditions.  The mesh
consists of two triangles forming a square.  

The information describing the examples may be divided into four
groups:

  * Global mesh information: see twotri3.mesh

  * Parameter settings common to all three examples: see pylithapp.cfg.

  * Material properties common to all three examples: see matprops.cfg.

  * Example-specific parameters and boundary condition specifications.

The examples and associated files are:

  * axialdisp

     Axial displacements are applied to the lower left and upper right
     corners of the square.

    - axialdisp.cfg:  Parameter settings
    - axialdisp.spatialdb: Database with Dirichlet BC values.

  * sheardisp

    The left edge of the square is pinned in the x-direction and moved
    downward in the y-direction, while the right edge is moved upward
    in the y-direction.

    - sheardisp.cfg:  Parameter settings
    - sheardisp.spatialdb:  Database with Dirichlet BC values.

  * dislocation

    Fault displacements are applied between the two triangles, while
    the lower left and upper right corners are fixed in x and y.

    - dislocation.cfg:  Parameter settings.
    - dislocation_slip.spatialdb:  Database with fault slip values.
    - dislocation_sliptime.spatialdb:  Database with slip initiation time 
        values.

All of the files are documented.  The 'pylithapp.cfg' file is read
automatically when running PyLith.  To add to or override these
settings, you may place an additional .cfg file on the command line.

To run the examples, you can type:

  pylith axialdisp.cfg
  pylith sheardisp.cfg
  pylith dislocation.cfg

Each of these commands will produce a suite of corresponding VTK
files, which may be viewed with visualization packages such as
ParaView, VISIT, or Mayavi.  The jpeg files in this directory show
results for the different examples visualized using ParaView.
