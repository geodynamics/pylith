This directory contains a simple problem that demonstrate the usage
of Neumann (traction) boundary conditions. The problem consists of two
rectangular elements that form a square with opposing corners (-1,-1) and
(1,1).  The y-displacement is fixed on y=1.  The vertex at (0,1) is also
fixed in the x-direction.  Traction BC are applied on y=-1.

A constant normal traction of 4.0e8 Pa is applied along y=-1.  This yields a
constant stress field within the domain where the yy-component is equal to
the applied traction.  The xx and xy components are both zero.  The
corresponding strain field is:

exx = -nu(1+nu)N/E
eyy = (1-nu^2)N/E
exy = 0

where nu is Poisson's ratio (0.25 for this problem), E is Young's
modulus (75 GPa for this problem), and N is the applied normal traction
(400 MPa for this problem).  Integrating the strain-displacement
relations and using the applied displacement BC, the corresponding
displacement field is:

u = -nu(1+nu)N*x/E
v = (1-nu^2)N*y/E-(1-nu^2)N/E

For the specified elastic properties and applied traction BC, this
should give values of:

u(-1) = 1.66667e-3 m
u(0) = 0 m
u(1) = -1.66667e-3 m
v(1) = 0 m
v(-1) = -0.01 m

Note that I didn't give values for v(0) since there are no vertices
there.
