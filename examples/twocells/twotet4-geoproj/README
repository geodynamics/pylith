This directory contains a single 3D elastic example problem.
This problem is similar to the kinematic fault problem in examples/twotet4.
The primary differences are that material properties are assigned using the
SCEC CVM-H database, and the amount of fault slip varies at each vertex.
The mesh consists of two tetrahedral elements.  The information describing
the examples may be divided into four groups:

1.  Global mesh information:  described in file twotet4.mesh

2.  Parameter settings common to all examples:  described in file
pylithapp.cfg.

3.  Material properties common to all examples:  described in the
database file matprops.spatialdb. Note that this file is not actually used
unless some of the settings are changed in dislocation.cfg.

4.  Example-specific parameters and boundary condition specifications.

The examples and associated files are:

1.  dislocation:  Fault displacements are applied between the two
elements, while the left and right corners are fixed in x, y, and z.
  a.  dislocation.cfg:  Parameter settings for this problem.
  b.  dislocation_slip.spatialdb:  Fault slip database for this problem.
  d.  dislocation_sliptime.spatialdb:  Fault slip time database for this
      problem.

All of the files are documented.  The 'pylithapp.cfg' file is read
automatically when running PyLith.  To add to or override these
settings, you may place an additional .cfg file on the command line.
To run the example, you can type:
pylith dislocation.cfg

This command will produce a set of VTK files, which may be viewed with
visualization packages such as ParaView or Mayavi. The JPEG file in this
directory shows a sample visualization for this problem using ParaView.
