# Left boundary is pinned in the horizontal direction (x direction).
# Bottom boundary is pinned in the vertical direction (y direction).
# Right side has a uniform horizontal (x) traction of 4.0e+08 Pa
#
# The uniform normal traction generates a uniform stress field within
# the domain, where the xx-component is equal to the applied
# traction. The yy and xy components are both zero. The corresponding
# strain field is:
#
# exx = (1 - nu^2) * N/E
# eyy = -nu * (1 + nu) * N/E
# exy = 0
#
# where nu is Poisson's ratio (0.25 for this problem), E is Young's modulus
# (75 GPa for this problem), and N is the applied normal traction (400 MPa
# for this problem). Integrating the strain-displacement relations and using
# the applied displacement BC, the corresponding displacement field is:
#
# u = (1 - nu^2) * N * (x - x0)/E
# v = nu * (1 + nu) * N * (y0 - y)/E
#
# where x0 and y0 are the minimum x and y-values respectively, along which
# displacements are fixed. Using the mesh, properties, and boundary conditions
# for this problem, the solution should be:
#
# exx = 5.0e-3
# eyy = -1.66667e-3
# exy = 0.0
#
# (-2,-1): u = 0.0,  v = -0.003333
# (-2, 1): u = 0.0,  v =  0.0
# ( 0,-1): u = 0.01, v = -0.003333
# ( 0, 1): u = 0.01, v =  0.0
# ( 2,-1): u = 0.02, v = -0.003333
# ( 2, 1): u = 0.02, v =  0.0
#
