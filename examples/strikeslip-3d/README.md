# Examples: 3D Strike-Slip Fault

This suite of examples demonstrates some basic concepts of using
PyLith with a single through-going strike-slip fault and a simple
3D domain. 

Intended for use with CATMIP - in development

## Meshing

We provide mesh files generated using Gmsh and Cubit.
We also include a Python script for generating the finite-element mesh with
triangular cells using Gmsh and Journal files for generating the
finite-element mesh with triangular or quadrilateral cell using Cubit.

## Step 4: create displacements
We start by imposing a synthetic slip distribution and forward-model the displacements of GPS stations at the surface. 

## Step 5: greens functions

## step 7: run catmip
