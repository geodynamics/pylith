# Examples

This directory contains a large suite of examples demonstrating most
of the features available in PyLith. The examples progress from vary
simple problems to more complex ones similar to those encountered in
research. The examples are broken up into the small sets listed below,
in which all of the simulations within a set use the same geometry.

All of the examples use HDF5 output. PyLith supports writing output as
VTK files, but this does not scale to large research level problems.
Additionally, PyLith supports HDF5 output with external data sets, and
this is the output recommended for large parallel runs.

## 2d/box

Simple axial and shear loading in a 2-D box with Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary conditions and isotropic, linear elasticty. The mesh is in an
ASCII file, generated by hand.

## 3d/box

Same simulations as those in 2d/box, but in 3-D. The mesh is from Cubit/Trelis.

## 2d/strikeslip

Throughoing strike-slip fault with prescribed slip and time-dependent
Dirichlet boundary conditions. The mesh, generated using Cubit/Trelis,
has a variable resolution with finer spacing near the fault.

## 2d/reverse

## 2d/subduction

## 2d/magma-chamber

Considering for future release.

## 3d/magma-chamber

Considering for future release.

## 3d/strike-slip

Planned for future release.

## 3d/subduction

## bar_shearwave

Not yet updated for v3.0.

## TODO: Add examples demonstrating these features:

  * Initial conditions


2d/strike-slip w/throughgoing fault
  tri mesh
  quad mesh (default)
  two materials (25% contrast)

  Step01: static w/prescribed slip; fixed boundaries
  Step02: quasistatic: boundaries move; fault catches up w/prescribed slip
  Step03: quasistatic: multiple earthquake cycles w/presscribed slip

  Exercises
    Change to tri mesh

2d/reverse w/buried fault + splay fault
  tri mesh (default)
  quad mesh
  three materials: upper crust, wedge, lower crust

  Step01: gravitational body forces (no reference state)
  Step02: gravitational body forces (reference state)
    Reference state (SimpleDB)
  Step03: gravitational body forces + incompressible elasticity
  Step05: distributed surface load
    Neumann BC (SimpleGridDB)
  Step06: coseismic slip (main fault)
  Step07: coseismic slip (main + splay fault)
  Step08: coseismic slip + viscoelastic relaxation w/linear Maxwell
  Step09: coseismic slip + viscoelastic relaxation w/powerlaw

  Exercises
    Change to quad mesh
    Compare basis order 1 and 2 for Steps 1 and 2
    Change material properties
