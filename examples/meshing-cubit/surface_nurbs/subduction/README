CUBIT example illustrating methods for creating nonplanar surfaces in
meshing a subduction interface with a steeply-dipping splay fault and
topography/bathymetry.

To generate the mesh for this example, we perform the following steps:

1.  Generate CUBIT journal files for creation of the surfaces:

    a.  Generate the subduction interface journal file by first
    running the Python script interface_netsurf.py. This reads points
    from interface_points.txt, which defines the interface geometry,
    and creates a CUBIT journal file to create the surface using a net
    surface.

      python interface_netsurf.py    

    b.  Generate the splay fault journal file by running the Python
    script splay_skinsurf.py. This reads points from the file
    splay_points.txt, which defines the splay fault geometry, and
    creates a CUBIT journal file to create the surface using a skin
    surface.

      python splay_skinsurf.py    

    c.  Generate the topography/bathymetry journal file by running the
    Python script topobath_netsurf.py script. This reads points from
    topobath_points.txt, which defines the topography/bathymetry, and
    creates a CUBIT journal file to create the surface using a net
    surface.

      python topobath_netsurf.py    

2.  Create the surfaces by running each of the three journal files
produced by the Python scripts within CUBIT.

    a.  interface_netsurf.jou creates the interface surface.

    b.  splay_skinsurf.jou creates the splay fault surface.

    c.  topobath_netsurf.jou creates the DEM surface.


3.  Generate the mesh using these surfaces by running the
    mesh.jou journal file within CUBIT. Note that this file also
    makes use of the following journal files:

    geometry.jou:  Imports the surfaces created in step 2 and creates the
                   volumes needed for meshing.

    bc.jou:        Creates material blocks and nodesets that could be used in
                   a PyLith simulation.
