# This is a simple Cubit journal file that creates a NURBS surface from a
# triangulated surface. To do this, you must first import the triangulated
# surface, create a mapped mesh on the surface, and then use the mapped
# mesh to create a net surface. The resulting surface may then be exported
# to an ACIS file.

# Import the Facets file.
import facets "ruapehu-nzmg-1km.fac" feature_angle 100 spline merge stitch

# Create a mapped mesh, using a size of 4 km.
surface 1 size 4000.0
surface 1 scheme map
mesh surface 1

# Smooth the mesh.
set debug 91 on
surface 1 smooth scheme condition number
smooth surface 1

# Create a net surface from the mapped mesh.
create surface net from mapped surface 1 heal

# Export the surface in binary ACIS format.
set geometry engine acis
export acis "ruapehu-nzmg-1km.sat" surface 2 overwrite
