This is a very simple example showing how to create a NURBS surface from a
set of contours using Cubit. Note that this example is pertinent to a set
of semi-parallel truncated contours. The example is a set of contours
defining the subduction interface for the Hikurangi subduction zone,
New Zealand. There are essentially three steps to creating the NURBS
surface:

1. The first step is probably not needed in many cases. In the original
data file (hikurangi_shiftrot.txt) many of the interal contours are
truncated, segmented, or incomplete. A Python script (fill_contours.py)
has been provided to fill in the missing contour sections, assuming that
the first and last contours are complete. The parameters to control this
script are in the file 'fill_contours.cfg'. Once the parameters have been
set, the script can be run by simply typing:

./fill_contours.py

This will create a new file named 'hikurangi_shiftrot_fill.txt'.

2.  Once we have a complete set of contours, we can convert them to
spline curve definitions that may be used by Cubit. A Python script
(cont2lines.py) has been provided to do this, and the parameters are set
in the file 'cont2lines.cfg'. Once the Python script is run, it will create
a separate spline curve Cubit command for each contour in the journal
directory. It will also create a main Cubit journal file
(hikurangi_mksurf.jou) that will playback all the journal files in the
journal directory and then create a skin surface using Cubit (see Cubit
documentation).

3.  We then just need to start Cubit and playback the hikurangi_mksurf.jou
file to create an ACIS NURBS surface (hikurangi_sub_geom.sab).

Once the NURBS surface has been created, it may be used in future Cubit
sessions by importing it:

import acis 'hikurangi_sub_geom.sab'
