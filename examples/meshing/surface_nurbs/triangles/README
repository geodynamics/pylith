This is a simple example showing how to create a NURBS surface from a
triangulated surface using Cubit. We use the same original data as we did
for the dem example (coarsely-sampled DEM of Mt Ruapehu volcano, New
Zealand). There are only two files in this directory in addition to this
README. The first (mkfacets.py) is a python script to create a Facets file
(readable by Cubit) from the DEM. We use the GMT 'triangulate' utility to
perform this task. Once the Facets file has been created, we can then use
the 'mksurface.jou' file within Cubit to create the NURBS surface. Note
that it is first necessary to create a mapped mesh on the original surface,
which means that the original triangulation is not really used.
