The following three examples demonstrate how to create NURBS surfaces
within CUBIT. 

contours - Example of creating a nonplanar fault surface using surface
           contours.

dem - Example of creating a topographic surface using a grid of spline
      curves.

triangles - Example of creating a NURBS surface from a triangulated
            surface in Facets format.

Additional examples show how to create volume meshes using different types
of surfaces.

merge_surfs - Example demonstrating how to join together several surfaces
              and use the merged surface to webcut a volume.

subduction - Example that uses both net surfaces and a skin surface for
             a semi-realistic demonstration of a subduction problem with
	     the subduction interface, a splay fault, and
	     topography/bathymetry.
