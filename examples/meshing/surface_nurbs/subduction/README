This example demonstrates a simple meshing example involving a subduction
interface, a steeply-dipping splay fault, and topography/bathymetry.

To generate the mesh for this example, we need to perform the following
steps:

1.  Create the Cubit journal files that will allow creation of the
    surfaces:

    a.  Create the subduction interface journal file by first running the
    interface_netsurf.py script. This will read points from the file
    interface_points.txt that define the interface geometry, and then
    creates a Cubit journal file to create the surface using a net
    surface.

    b.  Create the splay fault journal file by first running the
    splay_skinsurf.py script. This will read points from the file
    splay_points.txt that define the splay fault geometry, and then
    creates a Cubit journal file to create the surface using a skin
    surface.

    c.  Create the topography/bathymetry journal file by first running the
    topobath_netsurf.py script. This will read points from the file
    topobath_points.txt that define the topography/bathymetry, and then
    creates a Cubit journal file to create the surface using a net
    surface.

2.  Create the necessary surfaces by running Cubit with the journal files
    produced by the Python scripts:

    a.  Run the interface_netsurf.jou file to create the interface surface.

    b.  Run the splay_skinsurf.jou file to create the splay fault surface.

    c.  Run the topobath_netsurf.jou file to create the DEM surface.


3.  Create the mesh using these surfaces by running the meth_tet4.jou file
    within Cubit. Note that this file makes use of the following journal
    files:

    geometry.jou:  Imports the surfaces created in step 2 and creates the
                   volumes needed for meshing.

    bc.jou:        Creates material blocks and nodesets needed by the
                   finite element model.
