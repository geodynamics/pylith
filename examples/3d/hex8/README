The examples in this directory include (1) simple shearing of a box
and (2) slip on a through-going, vertical, strike-slip fault in a box
that is 6 km x 6 km x 4 km with linear hexahedral cells that have
edges 1.0 km long.

The box spans the volume:

  -3 km <= x <= +3 km
  -3 km <= y <= +3 km
  -6 km <= z <= 0  km.

The mesh is generated using CUBIT. Journal files are included and are
annotated to guide you through the GUI to replicate the commands in
the journal files should you prefer to use the GUI.

NOTE: Importing Exodus files into PyLith requires the netcdf
library. This is included in the PyLith binary distribution. If you
are compiling from the source code, you will want to use the
--enable-cubit option to turn on importing meshes from CUBIT (you must
have the netcdf library and header files installed when configuring
PyLith).

You can examine the Exodus file exported from CUBIT using the ncdump
command.

See the configuration files shearxy.cfg and dislocation.cfg on
instructions on how to run these simulations. The configuration files
also contain information about the simulation parameters.
