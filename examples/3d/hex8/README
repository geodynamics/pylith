The examples in this directory form a step-by-step sequence of 17 problems,
each building on the one before (for the most part). All of the examples
use the same mesh, which was created by Cubit.  The mesh is 6 km x 6 km x 4
km with linear hexahedral cells that have edges 1.0 km long.

The box spans the volume:

  -3 km <= x <= +3 km
  -3 km <= y <= +3 km
  -6 km <= z <= 0  km.

The mesh is generated using CUBIT. Journal files are included in the mesh
directory and are annotated to guide you through the GUI to replicate the
commands in the journal files should you prefer to use the GUI.

NOTE: Importing Exodus files into PyLith requires the netcdf
library. This is included in the PyLith binary distribution. If you
are compiling from the source code, you will want to use the
--enable-cubit option to turn on importing meshes from CUBIT (you must
have the netcdf library and header files installed when configuring
PyLith).

You can examine the Exodus file exported from CUBIT using the ncdump
command.

The examples are all described in the PyLith manual. Results of each
example are put in the stepxx directories after running the simulation.
Each simulation may be run by typing:

pylith stepxx.cfg

where xx is the number of the desired example.

spatialdb/powerlaw - This directory contains files needed to generate
power-law properties for PyLith, given the power-law parameters, a
temperature distribution, and a set of points for which properties are
desired. The powerlaw_gendb.py utility code is used from this directory
to create spatialdb/mat_powerlaw.spatialdb.

particular example. The example problems are briefly described below:

step01: Dirichlet BC (static)
step02: Neumann BC (static)
step03: Earthquake rupture (static)
step04: Dirichlet BC (quasi-static)
step05: Dirichlet + Neumann (quasi-static)
step06: Multiple earthquake rupture + creep (quasi-static)
step07: Earthquake rupture + creep + Dirichlet BC (quasi-static)
step08: Same as step07 with power-law rheology (quasi-static)
