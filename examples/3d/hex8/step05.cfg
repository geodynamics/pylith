# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# This is a time-dependent problem using a combination of constant
# velocity Dirichlet boundary conditions and time-dependent Neumann
# (traction) boundary conditions.

# This problem is similar to example 4, with the following differences:
# 1. The Dirichlet BC on -x in the y-direction include an initial
# displacement (applied in the elastic solution) as well as a constant
# velocity.
# 2. Neumann (traction) BC are applied in the -x direction on the +x face.
# An initial traction is applied in the elastic solution, and then at
# t=100 years the traction reduces linearly until it reaches zero at
# t=200 years (the end of the simulation).
#
# Two materials are used:
# 1. Elastic upper crust.
# 2. Viscoelastic (Maxwell) lower crust.

# RUNNING THE SIMULATON
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is not a self-contained simulation configuration file. This
# file only specifies parameters specific to tutorial step05.
# The general parameters are specificed in the pylithapp.cfg
# file which PyLith reads by default.
#
# To run the simulation:
# pylith step05.cfg
#
# Output will be directed to the directory step05.

# boundary conditions
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Set the parameters for boundary conditions applied on the
# +x, -x, and -z faces of the box.
#
# We fix the x degree of freedom on the -x face, and
# fix the z degree of freedom on the bottom (-z) face. Constant velocities
# in the +y direction are applied on -x, along with an initial displacement.
# On the +x face, we apply compressional traction (Neumann) BC initially,
# and then at t=100 years we begin reducing the magnitudes until they are
# reduced to zero at t=200 years (the end of the simulation).
#
# For x_neg, we use a UniformDB for both initial displacements and
# velocities.
#
# For z_neg, we keep the default ZeroDispDB, since we just want zero
# z-displacements on that boundary.

# The label corresponds to the name of the nodeset in CUBIT.
