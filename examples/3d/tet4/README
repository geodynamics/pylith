The examples in this directory include (1) simple shearing of a box,
(2) slip on a through-going, vertical, strike-slip fault in a
box, (3) a box subjected to body forces, and (4) a box subjected to body
forces where initial stresses are used to prevent deformation. In each
problem the domain is 6 km x 6 km x 4 km and is discretized with linear
tetrahedral cells that have edges nominally 1.0 km long.

The box spans the volume:

  -3 km <= x <= +3 km
  -3 km <= y <= +3 km
  -6 km <= z <= 0  km.

The mesh is generated using LaGrit. A LaGrit script is included and is
annotated to guide you through the process of generating the mesh.

See the configuration files shearxy.cfg, dislocation.cfg, gravity.cfg, and
gravity_istress.cfg for instructions on how to run these simulations. The
configuration files also contain information about the simulation
parameters.
