The examples in this directory include (1) simple shearing of a box
and (2) slip on a through-going, vertical, strike-slip fault in a
box. In each problem the domain is 6 km x 6 km x 4 km and is
discretized with linear tetrahedral cells that have edges nominally
1.0 km long.

The box spans the volume:

  -3 km <= x <= +3 km
  -3 km <= y <= +3 km
  -6 km <= z <= 0  km.

The mesh is generated using LaGrit. A LaGrit script is included and is
annotated to guide you through the process of generating the mesh.

See the configuration files shearxy.cfg and dislocation.cfg on
instructions on how to run these simulations. The configuration files
also contain information about the simulation parameters.
