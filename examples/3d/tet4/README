The examples in this directory form a step-by-step sequence of 4
problems, each building on the one before. All of the examples use the
same mesh, which was created using LaGriT. The first two problems
involve simple shearing of a box, and the second two problems involve
slip on a through-going, vertical, strike-slip fault in a box. The
domain is 6 km x 6 km x 4 km and is discretized with linear
tetrahedral cells that have edges nominally 1.0 km long.

The box spans the volume:

  -3 km <= x <= +3 km
  -3 km <= y <= +3 km
  -6 km <= z <= 0  km.

A LaGrit script is included and is annotated to guide you through the
process of generating the mesh.

See the configuration files step01.cfg and dislocation.cfg for
instructions on how to run these simulations. The configuration files
also contain information about the simulation parameters.

The examples are all described in the PyLith manual. Output from each
example is put in the output directory. Each simulation may be run by
typing:

  pylith stepxx.cfg

where xx is the number of the desired example.

DESCRIPTION OF FILES

README - This file.

pylithapp.cfg - PyLith configuration file containing parameters common to
all simulations.

stepxx.cfg - PyLith configuration file containing parameters for a
particular example. The example problems are briefly described below:

step01: Dirichlet BC (static) causing shear.
step02: step01 with mesh refinement and field split preconditioning.
step03: DirichletBC with fault slip (static) Slip on a vertical fault
step04: step03 with mesh refinement and field split preconditioning.
