This directory contains a wave propagation example problem. We create
a shear dislocation in a rectangular, elastic bar 8 km long with a
square cross-section 400 m on a side. The shear dislocation (the
vertices are fixed in the longitudinal and other shear direction)
generates a shear wave that propagates down the bar. Absorbing
boundary conditions on each end perfectly absorb the shear wave.
The bar is discretized with hexahedral cells.
