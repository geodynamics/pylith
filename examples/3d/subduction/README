The examples in this directory form a step-by-step sequence of 8
problems involving a 3-D subduction zone. In general, each example
builds on the previous one. All of the examples use the same mesh,
generated using CUBIT/Trelis.

See the PyLith User Manual for a detailed discussion of these examples.
