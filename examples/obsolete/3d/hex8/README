The examples in this directory form a step-by-step sequence of 21 problems,
each building on the one before (for the most part). All of the examples
use the same mesh, which was created by Cubit.  The mesh is 6 km x 6 km x 4
km with linear hexahedral cells that have edges 1.0 km long.

The box spans the volume:

  -3 km <= x <= +3 km
  -3 km <= y <= +3 km
  -6 km <= z <= 0  km.

The mesh is generated using CUBIT. Journal files are included in the mesh
directory and are annotated to guide you through the GUI to replicate the
commands in the journal files should you prefer to use the GUI.

NOTE: Importing Exodus files into PyLith requires the netcdf
library. This is included in the PyLith binary distribution. If you
are compiling from the source code, you will want to use the
--enable-cubit option to turn on importing meshes from CUBIT (you must
have the netcdf library and header files installed when configuring
PyLith).

You can examine the Exodus file exported from CUBIT using the ncdump
command.


The examples are all described in the PyLith manual. Output from each
example is put in the output directory. Each simulation may be run by
typing:

  pylith stepxx.cfg

where xx is the number of the desired example.

Note that the exception to this is step21.cfg (Green's function example).
It is run as follows:

pylith step21.cfg --problem=pylith.problems.GreensFns
