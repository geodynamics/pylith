# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# This problem demonstrates the use of slip-weakening fault friction for a
# quasi-static problem.
#
# The problem is similar to example 12, except that a different friction
# model is used. The model is run for 200 years.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# RUNNING THE SIMULATON
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is not a self-contained simulation configuration file. This
# file only specifies parameters specific to tutorial step13.
# The general parameters are specificed in the pylithapp.cfg
# file which PyLith reads by default.
#
# To run the simulation:
# pylith step13.cfg
#
# Output will be directed to the directory output.

# Set bc to an array of 3 boundary conditions: 'x_pos', 'x_neg', and 'z_neg'.

# Set interfaces to an array of 1 fault: 'fault'.

[pylithapp.timedependent.implicit]

# We will output the solution over the domain and the ground surface.
output = [domain,subdomain]

# Fault friction is a nonlinear problem so we need to use the nonlinear
# solver.

# Change the total simulation time to 200 years, and use a constant time
# step size of 5 years.

# boundary conditions
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Set the parameters for boundary conditions applied on the
# +x, -x, and -z faces of the box.
#
# On the -x and +x faces, we fix the x degrees of freedom and apply
# velocities in the y-direction. We fix the z degree of freedom on the
# bottom (-z) face.
#
# We use a UniformDB to apply the displacements and velocities, while
# retaining the default ZeroDispDB for zero x-displacements on the -x
# face and and zero z-displacements on -z.
#
# Note that since the fault cuts through the base of the model (z_neg),
# we can only constrain the portion of the bottom boundary that does not
# include the fault. A nodeset named 'face_zneg_nofault' has been defined
# in Cubit for this purpose.
#

# The label corresponds to the name of the nodeset in CUBIT.
