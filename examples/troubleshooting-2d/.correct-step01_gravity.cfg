# Applying gravitational body forces without a reference stress state
# will result in stresses and strains that increase linearly with
# depth. Consequently, the displacement field will increase with depth
# squared. To resolve this displacement field, we use a basis order of
# 2 for the displacement subfield in the solution.
#
# Most visualization programs do not support a solution specified with
# coefficients for second order basis functions. The workaround is to
# project the solution to a basis order of 1 when we write the
# solution field. PyLith does this automatically.
#
# For fields that are uniform, we use a basis order of 0 to minimize
# memory use.
