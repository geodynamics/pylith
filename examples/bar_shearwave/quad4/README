The bar is discretized with quadrilateral cells. Detailed descriptions
of the problems are in the .cfg files associated with each example. In
each example the output (VTK files) are written to the output
directory.

Example problems

  * Prescribed rupture (same as problem in tri3, tet4, and hex8
    subdirectories)

  * Spontaneous rupture with static friction fault constitutive model

  * Spontaneous rupture with linear slip-weakening fault constitutive model

  * Spontaneous rupture with rate- and state-friction fault constitutive model
