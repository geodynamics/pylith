This directory contains a wave propagation example problem. We create
a shear dislocation in a rectangular, elastic bar 8 km long with a
square cross-section 400 m on a side. In 2-D the we use a mid-surface
cross-section and plane strain conditions. The shear dislocation (the
vertices are fixed in the longitudinal and other shear direction)
generates a shear wave that propagates down the bar. Absorbing
boundary conditions on each end perfectly absorb the shear wave.

The problem can be run by entering

  pylith

in any of the subdirectories.
