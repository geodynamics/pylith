This directory contains a wave propagation example problem. We create
a shear dislocation in a rectangular, elastic bar 8 km long with a
square cross-section 400 m on a side. In 2-D the we use a mid-surface
cross-section and plane strain conditions. The shear dislocation (the
vertices are fixed in the longitudinal and other shear direction)
generates a shear wave that propagates down the bar. Absorbing
boundary conditions on each end perfectly absorb the shear wave.

The problem can be run by entering

  pylith

in the tri3, tet4, or hex8 subdirectories. The quad4 subdirectory also
contains some additional dynamic examples, so the problem is run by
entering "pylith shearwave_kinematicslip.cfg".

  - tri3: Mesh with triangular cells
  - quad4: Mesh with quadrilateral cells
  - tet4: Mesh with tetrahedral cells

Each of the tri3, tet4, and hex8 subdirectories contains the files
listed below (along with other files for the mesh). The files in the
quad4 subdirectory are named differently (see the README in the quad4
subdirectory for more information).

  - pylithapp.cfg: Parameter settings for the shear wave dislocation problem
  - matprops.spatialdb: Material database of physical properties
  - shearwave_slip.spatialdb: Spatial database with values for final slip
  - shearwave_sliprate.spatialdb: Spatial database with values for the
    peak slip rate
  - shearwave_sliptime.spatialdb: Spatial database with values for the
    slip initiation time
