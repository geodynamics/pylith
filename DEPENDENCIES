See INSTALL for suggested methods for installing PyLith.

REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES

Note that many of these packages must be configured using non-default
arguments for use with PyLith. While in most cases PyLith is
compatible with the latest versions of the packages on which it
depends, there may be dependencies that may have been updated since
PyLith's latest release. For these reasons, we strongly recommend
using the PyLith installer utility for installing PyLith.

Note: Several of these packages (for example, Python, PETSc, proj)
      have additional dependencies.

Python
MPI (mpich, openmpi, etc)
PETSc (knepley/pylith branch)
pythia (https://geodynamics.org/resources/pythia)
spatialdata (https://geodynamics.org/resources/spatialdata)
proj (https://trac.osgeo.org/proj/)
numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
SWIG (if building from repository)
