  # Sample time history definition file for TECTON.
  # Each history consists of two or more lines.  The first line defines
  # the number of points defining the history and the default load
  # value for the history.  Subsequent lines define time, load pairs.
  #
  # The definitions are as follows:
  #
  #   npoints  = The number of points defining the given history.
  #   defval   = The value assigned to every point by default.  The
  #              default value is then overridden by load values.
  #   time     = The time value for a given point.
  #   load     = The load value for a given point.
  #
  #  npoints(i)   defval(i)
  #  time(j,i)    load(j,i), j=1,points(i), i=1,nhistories
