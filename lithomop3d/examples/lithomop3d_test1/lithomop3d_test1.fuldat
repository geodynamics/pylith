  # Sample output specification file for TECTON.  This file gives the
  # step numbers for which full output is desired, one entry per line.
  # This file is required for time-dependent problems and is ignored
  # for elastic problems. Output is always produced for the elastic
  # solution, so it is not necessary to specify step 0.
  #
  #   icontr(i) = Time step number for which to produce a full output.
