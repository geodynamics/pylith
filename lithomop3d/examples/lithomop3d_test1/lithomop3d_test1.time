  # Sample time step group definition file for TECTON.  This file
  # contains several integer and real parameters that must be defined
  # for each group.  Note that the elastic solution corresponds to
  # group number 0 and must always be defined.  Some of the parameters
  # have no meaning for the elastic solution but they are defined
  # anyway.  In the fortran code, each of the parameters (other than n)
  # is stored in a separate array of dimension nintg+1, where nintg
  # is the number of time step groups.  The definitions are as follows:
  #   n      = time step group number.  The elastic solution
  #            corresponds to group number 0, and must always be
  #            defined.
  #   maxstp = the number of steps in the group (this is always 1 for
  #            the elastic solution).
  #   delt   = time step size.  This is a real value with units of
  #            time.
  #   alfa   = amount of implicitness.  This is a real dimensionless
  #            parameter with values that can range from 0.0 (fully
  #            explicit) to 1.0 (fully implicit).  The value is
  #            generally set to 0.5.
  #   maxit  = maximum number of time steps before stiffness matrix is
  #            reformed.
  #   maxitc = maximum number of equilibrium iterations before stiffness
  #            matrix is reformed.
  #   lgdef  = large deformation solution flag.  This is an integer
  #            parameter with 3 possible values:
  #            0:  linear strain
  #            1:  large strain, but use only the linear contribution
  #                to the stiffness matrix.  This sometimes gives
  #                better convergence.
  #            2:  large strain using the nonlinear contribution to the
  #                stiffness matrix.
  #   ibbar  = strain-displacement matrix formulation flag.  This is an
  #            integer flag that could be implemented as a boolean.  The
  #            possible values are:
  #            0:  use normal formulation
  #            1:  use Hughes' b-bar formulation for dilatational
  #                strain.
  # Convergence criteria for the nonlinear iterative solution:
  #
  #   utol   = convergence tolerance for displacements.  This is a
  #            dimensionless real value.
  #   ftol   = convergence tolerance for forces.  This is a
  #            dimensionless real value.
  #   etol   = convergence tolerance for energy.  This is a
  #            dimensionless real value.
  #   itmax  = maximum number of equilibrium iterations.  This is an
  #            integer quantity.
  #
  # Note that the convergence criteria defined below are appropriate for
  # a linear elastic problem.  The values would be much different for a
  # nonlinear or time-dependent problem.
  #
  # The only parameter in this list requiring units is the time step
  # size, with units of time.  I generally make sure everything is
  # converted to seconds, although I frequently specify time in years.
  #
  time_units = year    # This should be converted to seconds.
  #
  # Below is the time step group information for a single elastic time
  # step.  The code should parse this line, store each parameter
  # (other than n) in a seperate array (list), and return the number of
  # time step groups read (nintg).
