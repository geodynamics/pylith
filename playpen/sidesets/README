This directory contains simple examples based on 3d/hex8 to produce sidesets
using Cubit. There are examples for both hex8 and tet4 meshes.

The resulting Exodus II file then contains extra entries analogous to
nodesets. The file first lists the cells associated with each face on the
surface (elem_ssX), and then the face number for each face on the surface.
The ordering of faces for Exodus II files is shown in the attached JPEG
file.
