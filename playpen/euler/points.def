# Dummy set of points all with normals oriented upward at 45 degrees in
# the x-z plane.
# The rotation pole defined in euler.cfg is located 90 degrees away
# along an initial bearing of 90 degrees (due east), so that movement
# is all N-S.
#
# The first three points all have the same orientation and minor
# variations in location.  Movement should all be strike-slip for these
# points.
