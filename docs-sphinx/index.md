:class: warning

We are in the process of migrating the documentation from LaTeX producing a PDF file to Markedly Structured Text (MyST) and Sphinx producing this online documentation, a PDF file, and epub.

We are starting with the developer documentation and some other random pieces that are not in the LaTeX manual.
