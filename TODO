  1. Reverse-slip benchmark.
    a. Create BC for CUBIT mesh.
    b. Create BC for LaGriT mesh.

    d. Generate analytic solutions.
    e. Tabulate results.


======================================================================
KNOWN DEFICIENCIES
======================================================================

* Dirichlet BC and fault BC

  Can't use block Jacobi preconditioner when Dirichlet BC overlap with
  fault BC's, because we end up with a DOF associated with a Lagrange
  multiplier that is "free". Not sure if this is okay, when the fault
  is at an angle to the boundary.

    Might be able to fix this problem by examining constraints
    relative to orientation and if orientation coincides with
    preexisting constraint, then constrain Lagrange multiplier DOF.

  Need better error trapping when using LineParser. State of
  ifstream is insufficient. Need state of istringstream buffer, but it
  is often !good() at eof(). Test of !good() and !eof()?

* FixedDOFDB

  The default BC is FixedDOF which hardwires the values in a UniformDB
  to 0. No error message is generated if the user sets the values or
  data properties and they are overwritten by the hardwired values. A
  possible solution is for FixedDOF to use a C++ UniformDB but not
  inherit from the Python UniformDB.

======================================================================
MISC PRIORITIES (Brad)
======================================================================

1. Want to take advantage of symmetry and block structure of Jacobian
   matrix when possible.

2. Additional unit tests
  a. FaultCohesive
    i. Add checking of faultMesh [not currently used]

3. Allow use of all elasticity constants (9 for 2-D, 36 for 3-D).
   a. Materials C++ code
   b. Integrator C++ code
   b. Material C++ unit tests

4. OutputManager
   a. VertexFilterChangeCS
      OutputFilter for writing vertex coordinates in another 
      coordinate system. Need test for whether two coordinate systems 
      are the same.

LONG TERM WISH LIST

         Would prefer to include multiple materials

         Datasets contain entire time histories (makes it possible to
         slice along time or space)

       Point locations (arbitrary location such as instrument site)

         Interpolate solution to desired location
         Solution field (time history)

  5. Use shared pointers for objects where both Python and C++ hold pointers.

THINGS WE NEED SIEVE TO DO (Matt)
======================================================================

2. Construct mesh with higher order cells from mesh with lower order cells.

  Many mesh generators do not know how to construct higher order
  elements, so we will need a general utility for doing this.

  Inputs:
    * PETSc Mesh
    * some sort of map (Python object) defining how to construct
      higher order reference cell from lower order reference cell.
  Output:
    * PETSc Mesh

  This already works. Our code is written in terms of numBasisFuncs, not
  vertices. Therefore, if we just use the P2 element from FIAT, our only
  problem is to correctly allocate the section (I think). To do this, we
  add the appropriate setFiberDimension() call. FIAT has this information,
  we just are not using it right now.

3. Uniform refinement of mesh.

  Inputs:
    * PETSc Mesh (original)
    * refinement factor (limited to factor of 2- 2 or 4)
  Outputs:
    * PETSc Mesh (refined)

  This already works. You just call

  double maxVolume   = 0.01;
  bool   interpolate = false;
  ALE::Obj<ALE::Mesh> newMesh = ALE::Generator::refineMesh(oldMesh, maxVolume, interpolate);

  There is another version that takes an array of maxVolumes, one for each cell in oldMesh.

6. Coarsening for PyLith meshes

7. Time fixes

  Not used a. Remove extra time in uninterpolated restrict(). May need special method for P1.

  Done c. getStateVars() is way too expensive. 

  Not used d. Same as a) for update

8. Memory fixes

  Done a. Share memory in precomputation sections

11. For Schur complement directly for mass matrix and Lagrange multiplier problem
