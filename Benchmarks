A list of existing benchmarks, and notes about each:
#----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5D/benchmarks/savageprescott:
This benchmark runs but runs out of iterations before converging.
The solver/dimensionalization settings probably need updating.
This benchmark is described in the manual but is probably out of date.

SCEC Crustal Deformation benchmark

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
3D/PyLith/benchmarks/dynamic/halfspace_strikeslip:
This benchmark runs for both the hex8 and tet4 cases.
There is some debugging output that we may want to remove, and we may want
to update some PETSc settings.
This benchmark is not described in the manual.

Performance benchmark (EqSim vs. PyLith)

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
3D/PyLith/benchmarks/dynamic/scecdynrup/tpv205:
This benchmark was missing the output directory. It ran after that was
added.
This benchmark is not described in the manual.

SCEC Dynamic Rupture benchmark

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
3D/PyLith/benchmarks/dynamic/scecdynrup/tpv205-2d:
This benchmark runs for both the 100m and 200m cases.
We may want to update some of the PETSc logging info.
This benchmark is not described in the manual.

SCEC Dynamic Rupture benchmark

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
3D/PyLith/benchmarks/trunk/quasistatic/dike-disloc:
This benchmark needs an update of the .cfg files (doesn't work).
This benchmark is not described in the manual.

Mesh too big for examples, but may not be a real benchmark.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
3D/PyLith/benchmarks/trunk/quasistatic/reversenog:
This benchmark needs an update of the .cfg files (runs but has warnings).
We also probably need to update some of the output settings (e.g., use
time scaling in the output file names).
This benchmark is not described in the manual.

SCEC Crustal Deformation benchmark

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
3D/PyLith/benchmarks/trunk/quasistatic/solvertest:
This benchmark may need updating of PETSc settings. There is a warning about
options that were not used:
WARNING! There are options you set that were not used!
WARNING! could be spelling mistake, etc!
Option left: name:-sub_pc_factor_shift_nonzero no value
Option left: name:-sub_pc_factor_shift_positive_definite value: 0
This benchmark is not described in the manual. I don't think it is really
a benchmark.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
3D/PyLith/benchmarks/trunk/quasistatic/strikeslipnog:
This benchmark runs, but doesn't converge because it runs out of iterations.
We probably need to adjust the solver/dimensionalization settings.
This benchmark is described in the manual, but is probably out of date.

SCEC Crustal Deformation benchmark

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
3D/PyLith/benchmarks/trunk/static/sceccvmh:
Neither the volume or slice problems work.  The .cfg files probably need
updating.
This benchmark is not described in the manual and is not really a benchmark.

Test with mesh too big for source tree.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Future benchmarks?
#----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Hole in an elastic whole-space:
This is a rough test of Drucker-Prager plasticity (current solution is for
Mohr-Coulomb). The problem is really 2D and we would be representing it in
3D.

2.  Viscoelastic tests for a brick-shaped domain:
These tests would work for either Maxwell or power-law. This is just a
uniaxial strain test where we have analytical solutions for the
time-dependent stress relaxation. The existing mesh in examples/3d/hex8
should work fine for both.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ideas for cleaning things up:
#----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Move everything int 3D/PyLith/benchmarks?

2.  If something is not really a benchmark, should we have another directory
    (3D/PyLith/tests) that allows full-scale testing with large meshes, but
    would not need to be described in the manual?
