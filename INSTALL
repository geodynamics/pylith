Installation instructions are available in the PyLith manual
available on the CIG website
(http://www.geodynamics.org/cig/software/pylith).

We *STRONGLY* recommend that you first become familiar with PyLith
using the binary packages before attempting to install PyLith from
source. If you want to install from source, we recommend using the
PyLith Installer, which is available on the PyLith webpage listed
above.
