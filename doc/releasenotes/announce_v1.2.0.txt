Greetings,

I am pleased to announce the release of PyLith 1.2.0, a finite-element
code designed to solve dynamic elastic problems and quasi-static
viscoelastic problems in tectonic deformation.

This release uses a new, more memory efficient Sieve implementation
and adds new features, including multiple kinematic earthquake
ruptures on a fault surface, two new slip time functions, and
gravitational body forces. This release also fixes some minor build
issues and corrects typos in the manual and installation
instructions. We encourage all users of PyLith 1.1 to switch to this
latest release.

You can download the source code and binaries from

    http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/packages/short/pylith

Installation instructions are in the bundled README and INSTALL  
files, as well as in the User Manual on the web page.


RELEASE NOTES

  * New Sieve implementation

    Previously Sieve provided a very generalized implementation of
    data structures and operations for finite-element
    meshes. Switching to a more rigid implementation streamlined the
    data structures, resulting in a significant reduction in the
    memory use for storing the mesh. This leads to an overall
    reduction in memory use of 25-30% in many cases. [IS DISTRIBUTION
    FIXED?]

  * Multiple kinematic ruptures

    A single kinematic rupture on a fault has been replaced by a
    dynamic array of kinematic ruptures. This allows creation of an
    arbitrary number of kinematic ruptures on each fault
    surface. Spatial databases for the slip and slip initiation time
    control the spatial and temporal extent of slip in each rupture
    independently. Additionally, the rupture time at each location on
    the fault surface is specified with respect to the origin time of
    the corresponding earthquake rupture.

  * New slip time functions

    - Step slip time function (now the default)

      This slip time function simplifies specifying instantaneous slip
      in a quasi-static simulation compared with using the Brune slip
      time function.

    - Constant slip rate slip time function

      This slip time function permits prescribing a constant slip rate.

  * Gravitational body forces

    Gravitational body forces are implemented (they are turned off by
    default). The direction and acceleration of gravity may be specified.

  * Known issues

      - PyLith still uses much more memory that PyLith 0.8 [UPDATE].

      - The preconditioner for explicit time stepping provides
        relatively poor overall performance compared to a direct solve
        with traditional mass lumping. An appropriate preconditioner and
        traditional mass lumping will be supported in a future release.

MIGRATING FROM VERSION 1.1 TO 1.2

  There are two new features in PyLith version 1.2 that require users
  to adjust input parameters from those used with PyLith 1.1. A
  dynamic array of kinematic rupture replaces a single kinematic
  rupture on a fault. Additionally, the default slip time function is
  now a step-function. This eliminates the need to specify a peak slip
  rate for quasi-static simulations. When using PyLith version 1.2
  with a problem previously setup for PyLith 1.1, look for warnings
  about unknown components and settings in the screen output at the
  beginning of a run.
