Greetings,

I am pleased to announce the release of PyLith 1.5.0, a finite-element
code designed to solve dynamic elastic problems and quasi-static
viscoelastic problems in tectonic deformation.

This release adds several new features to PyLith, including (1) fault
friction with several widely-used fault constitutive models, (2) an
optimized solver for explicit time-stepping with a lumped Jacobian
sparse matrix, (3) Total Langrangian formulation for large
deformations, (4) use of scientific notation in VTK output files with
user-specified precision, (5) ??, (6) ??, and (7) ??. We encourage all
users of previous PyLith releases to switch to this latest release.

We strongly recommend all users of previous PyLith releases to switch
to this latest release. Switching from v1.4.0 or v1.4.1 to v1.4.2 only
requires changes to parameter files when using adaptive time stepping
with a non-default stability factor (see the release notes below for
details). See the README file for changes required to switch to the
v1.4.x release series from previous versions.

You can download the source code and binaries from

Detailed installation instructions are in the User Manual with example
installation procedures for a few platforms in the bundled doc/install
directory.
