Greetings,

I am pleased to announce the release of PyLith 1.3.1, a finite-element
code designed to solve dynamic elastic problems and quasi-static
viscoelastic problems in tectonic deformation.

This release fixes several bugs associated with running PyLith in
parallel. These include selection of the partitioner and calculating
the change in tractions on the fault surface. The PETSc logging has
been enhanced by separating the events using stages. This release also
includes some minor performance improvements to the Sieve
implementation. We encourage all users of previous PyLith releases to
switch to this latest release.

You can download the source code and binaries from

    http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/packages/short/pylith

Installation instructions are in the bundled README and INSTALL  
files, as well as in the User Manual on the web page.


RELEASE NOTES

  * Added stages to PETSc logging (--petsc.log_summary=1) to collect
    event logging into groups.

  * Bug fixes

    - Fixed partitioning options. Partitioning options were ignored in
      the 1.3.0 release.

    - Fixed assembling of Jacobian, residual, and fault sections
      across processors. This bug caused errors in the computation of
      the change in tractions over the fault surface.
