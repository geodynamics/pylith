Greetings,

I am pleased to announce the release of PyLith 1.5.2, a finite-element
code designed to solve dynamic elastic problems and quasi-static
viscoelastic problems in tectonic deformation.

This release fixes several bugs in v1.5.1. We strongly recommend
all users of previous PyLith releases to switch to this latest
release. See the README file for changes required to switch to the
v1.5.x release series from previous versions.

You can download the source code and binaries from

    http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/packages/short/pylith

Detailed installation instructions are in the User Manual with example
installation procedures for a few platforms in the bundled doc/install
directory.


RELEASE NOTES

  * PyLith 1.5.2 requires FIAT version 0.9.9 or later and an updated
    PETSc development version. It also requires users to update to the
    latest spatialdata version for compatibility of the SWIG generated
    files. These are included in the binary distribution, but users
    building PyLith from source will need to update FIAT, PETSc, and
    spatialdata.

  * Bug fixes

    - Fixed setting of elastic constants in DruckerPrager3D and
      computation of the yield function. Some off-diagonal elasticity
      constants were off by a factor of 2.0 and the yield function was
      missing a factor of 0.5 and sqrt().

    - Fixed computation of stable time step when using initial
      stresses with PowerLaw3D. If effective stress is zero, then
      stable time step is infinite.

    - Re-enabled check for compatibility of quadrature scheme and
      cells for bulk rheologies.

    - Added check to configure for compatible version of FIAT.

    - Fixed bug where buffer for output of initial stresses for
      dynamic (spontaneous) rupture.
