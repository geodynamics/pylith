Greetings,

I am pleased to announce the release of PyLith 1.4.0, a finite-element
code designed to solve dynamic elastic problems and quasi-static
viscoelastic problems in tectonic deformation.

This release adds several new features to PyLith, including (1) a
Power-law nonlinear bulk rheology [2-D Maxwell viscoelastic model],
(2) the ability to specify the initial stress, strain, and state
variables for bulk rheologies, (3) integration with PETSc nonlinear
solvers, (4) transparent nondimensionalization of all parameters, (5)
parsing of units in spatial database files, (6) and replacement of
Pyrex/Pyrexembed with SWIG. Nondimensionalization the problem restores
the symmetry of the Jacobian matrix, which dramatically reduces memory
use. Several other changes to the code have also helped reduce
runtime. We encourage all users of previous PyLith releases to switch
to this latest release.

You can download the source code and binaries from

Installation instructions are in the bundled README and INSTALL  
files, as well as in the User Manual on the web page.
