      PyLith
        Faults, Topology, BC, FEAssemble, Problems, MeshIO, Solver, Materials
      PETSc
      Sieve
      MPI

7.  Governing equations [MOSTLY DONE]

  Remove margin notes, check if possible. [CHARLES]

8.  Running PyLith

  Insert cross-references.
  Could use an overview of what happens when you run PyLith.

9.  Installing binary PyLith

   [CHARLES- NEED TO GET BINARY AND WRITE INSTRUCTIONS]

   Installation from source [Leif will write after CFEM]


11. Tutorials (all using ascii mesh format?) [CHARLES]

    a.  Two-triangle problem.

        i. Dirichlet boundary conditions (shear)

        ii. Dirichlet boundary conditions (fixed) and fault

    b.  Two-quad problem.

        i. Dirichlet boundary conditions (fixed) and fault

    c.  Two-tet shear viscoelastic problem?

    d.  Two-hex element shear viscoelastic problem?

    e.  LaGrit/CUBIT problem with fault and Dirichlet (fixed) BC

        i. Provide LaGriT and CUBIT scripts with comments.
        ii. Describe process for setting up meshes for export from LaGriT/CUBIT.

12. Material models (should be able to copy from 0.8 with some editing) [Charles]

    * MaxwellIsotropic3D [Charles]

      [CHARLES - need to rewrite formulation in terms of mu and lambda]

      [CHARLES - also list material modesl that will be added soon]

      [CHARLES - Create table with spatial database parameter names]

    c. List material models in 0.8 that will be added soon.

13. Boundary and interface conditions (includes faults)

   [BRAD]

    d.  Fault

      i. Conventions (sign, orientation info)

      ii. Cohesive cells (described how faults implemented)

      iii. Kinematic earthquake source

14. Appendix [DONE]
