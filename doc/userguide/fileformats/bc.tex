\subsection{xx.bc}

The \filename{xx.bc} file specifies the displacements, velocity,
and/or forces applied to vertices on the boundaries.

# File containing boundary conditions at vertices.

# Comment lines begin with '#'
#
# First, specify units of coordinates for each type of boundary
# conditon.  All three are required even if they are not all used.

displacement_units = m
velocity_units = m/s
force_units = newton

#
# Boundary conditions applied to vertices. You must specify a flag and
# value for each degree of freedom, even if some are free.
#
# Columns:
#   (1) Vertex number
#   (2) Boundary condition flag for x DOF
#   (3) Boundary condition flag for y DOF
#   (4) Boundary condition flag for z DOF
#       0 = Free
#       1 = Fixed displacement
#       2 = Constant velocity
#       3 = Constant force
#       A 2 or more digit code may be used for the boundary condition
#       flag.  If used, the the final digit refers to the condition
#       type as defined above, while the beginning digit(s) refer to
#       the time history to be used.
#   (5) Boundary condition value for x DOF
#   (6) Boundary condition value for y DOF
#   (7) Boundary condition value for z DOF
