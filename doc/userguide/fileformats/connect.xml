# File containing finite-element mesh topology and material type information.
#
# Comment lines begin with '#'
#
# Columns:
#   (1) Element number
#   (2) Element type
#        1 = Linear hexahedron (8 vertices) [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
#        2 = Linear hexahedron with 1 set of collapsed vertices (7 vertices)
#            [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
#        3 = Linear hexahedron with 2 sets of collapsed vertices (6 vertices)
#            [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
#        4 = Linear hexahedron with 4 vertices collapsed to a point (5 vertices)
#            [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
#        5 = Linear tetrahedron (4 vertices)
#        6 = Quadratix hexahedron (20 vertices) [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
#        7 = Quadratic hexahedron with 3 vertices along one edge collapsed to a 
#            point (18 vertices) [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
#        8 = Quadratic hexahedron with 3 sets of collapsed vertices (15 vertices)
#            [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
#        9 = Quadratic hexahedron with 9 vertices collapsed to a point (13 vertices)
#            [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
#       10 = Quadratic tetrahedron (10 vertices)  [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
#   (3) Material type, numbered consecutively beginning with '1'
#   (4) Infinite element flag, required but not currently implemented
#        0 = only valid value
#   (5)+ Vertices in the element, identified by vertex number
#
