\begin_layout Standard
The Crustal Deformation Modeling and Earthquake Source Physics Focus Groups
 within the Southern California Earthquake Center and the Short-Term Tectonics
 Working Group within CIG have developed a suite of benchmarks to test the
 accuracy and performance of 3D numerical codes for quasi-static crustal
 deformation and earthquake rupture dynamics.
 The benchmark definitions for the quasi-static crustal deformation benchmarks
 are posted on the CIG website at Short-Term Tectonics Benchmarks

.
 This suite of benchmarks permits evaluating the relative performance of
 different types of basis functions, quadrature schemes, and discretizations
 for geophysical applications.
 The files needed to run the 3D benchmarks are in the CIG SVN Repository

.
 In addition to evaluating the efficiency and accuracy of numerical codes,
 the benchmarks also make good test problems, where users can perform simulation
s based on actual geophysical problems.
 The benchmarks are performed at various resolutions and using different
 element types.
 By comparing the runtime and accuracy for different resolutions and element
 types, users can evaluate which combination will be best for their problems
 of interest.

 includes a graphical user interface for examining the benchmark results.
 Benchmark results for PyLith are available for TPV205-2D (horizontal slice
 through a vertical strike-slip fault), TPV205 (vertical strike-slip fault
 with high and low stress asperities), TPV210-2D (vertical slice through
 a 60-degree dipping normal fault), TPV210 (60-degree dipping normal fault),
 TPV11, TPV12, TPV13, TPV14-2D and TPV15-2D (horizontal slice through a
 verticel strike-slip fault with a branch), TPV14 and TPV15 (vertical strike-sli
p fault with a branch), and TPV 16 and 17.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The benchmark results indicate that triangular and tetrahedral cells generate
 less numerical noise than quadrilateral or hexahedral cells.
 Results for all of the benchmarks listed above except TPV14-2D, TPV15-2D,
 TPV14, and TPV15 have been updated using PyLith 1.7, which provides much
 closer agreement with the other codes compared to previous versions of
 PyLith.
 We attribute the closer agreement to small adjustments of the fault implementat
ion and some small bugfixes to the slip-weakening friction formulation.
