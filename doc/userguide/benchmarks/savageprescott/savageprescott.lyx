Savage and Prescott Benchmark
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This benchmark problem computes the viscoelastic (Maxwell) relaxation of
 stresses from repeated infinite, strike-slip earthquakes in 3D without
 gravity.

.
 An analytical solution to this problem is described by Savage and Prescott
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Savage:Prescott:1978"

\end_inset

, which provides a simple way to check our numerical solution.
 A python utility code is provided in the utils directory to compute the
 analytical solution.
 Although this problem is actually 2.5D (infinite along-strike), we solve
 it using a 3D finite element model.

Problem Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 shows the geometry of the problem, as described by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Savage:Prescott:1978"

\end_inset

.
 The analytical solution describes the surface deformation due to repeated
 earthquakes on an infinite strike-slip fault embedded in an elastic layer
 overlying a Maxwell viscoelastic half-space.
 The upper portion of the fault (red in the figure) is locked between earthquake
s, while the lower portion (blue in the figure) creeps at plate velocity.
 At regular recurrence intervals, the upper portion of the fault abruptly
 slips by an amount equal to the plate velocity multiplied by the recurrence
 interval, thus 'catching up' with the lower part of the fault.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some differences between the analytical solution and our numerical
 representation.
 First, the analytical solution represents the earthquake cycle as the superposi
tion of uniform fault creep and an elementary earthquake cycle.
 Uniform fault creep is simply the uniform movement of the two plates past
 each other at plate velocity.
 For the elementary earthquake cycle, no slip occurs below the locked portion
 of the fault (blue portion in the figure).
 On the locked (red) portion of the fault, backslip equal to plate velocity
 occurs until the earthquake recurrence interval, at which point abrupt
 forward slip occurs.
 In the finite element solution, we perform the simulation as described
 in the figure.
 Velocity boundary conditions are applied at the extreme edges of the model
 to simulate block motion, steady creep is applied along the blue portion
 of the fault, and regular earthquakes are applied along the upper portion
 of the fault.
 It takes several earthquake cycles for the velocity boundary conditions
 to approximate the steady flow due to steady block motion, so we would
 not expect the analytical and numerical solutions to match until several
 earthquakes have occurred.
 Another difference lies in the dimensions of the domain.
 The analytical solution assumes an infinite strike-slip fault in an elastic
 layer overlying a Maxwell viscoelastic half-space.
 In our finite element model we are restricted to finite dimensions.
 We therefore extend the outer boundaries far enough from the region of
 interest to approximate boundaries at infinity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the difficulties in representing solutions in an infinite domain,
 there are several meshes that have been tested for this problem.
 The simplest meshes have uniform resolution (all cells have equal dimensions);
 however, such meshes typically do not provide accurate solutions since
 the resolution is too coarse in the region of interest.
 For that reason, we also tested several meshes where the mesh resolution
 decreases away from the center.
 In the problem description that follows, we will focus on the graded3 mesh
 (in 
\family typewriter
meshes/spbm_hex8_graded4_20km.exo.gz
\family default
), which provides reasonable results.
 It will first be necessary to unzip this mesh so that it may be used by
 PyLith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Domain The domain for this mesh spans the region
\begin_inset Formula \begin{gather*}
-1000\leq x\leq1000\ km,\\
-500\leq y\leq500\ km,\\
-400\ km\leq z\leq0.\end{gather*}

\end_inset

The top (elastic) layer occupies the region 
\begin_inset Formula $-40\ km\ \leq z\leq0$
\end_inset

 and the bottom (viscoelastic) layer occupies the region 
\begin_inset Formula $-400\ km\ \leq z\leq-40\ km$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Material
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

properties The material is a Poisson solid with a shear modulus (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

) of 30 GPa.
 The domain is modeled using an elastic isotropic material for the top layer
 and a Maxwell viscoelastic material for the bottom layer.
 The bottom layer has a viscosity (
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

) of 4.73364e19 Pa-s, yielding a relaxation time (
\begin_inset Formula $2\eta/\mu$
\end_inset

) of 100 years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Fault The fault is a vertical, left-lateral strike-slip fault.
 The strike is parallel to the y-direction at the center of the model:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{gather*}
x=0\ km,\\
-500\leq y\leq500\ km,\\
-40\ km\leq z\leq0.\end{gather*}

\end_inset

The locked portion of the fault (red section in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:benchmark:savageprescott:geometry"

\end_inset

) extends from 
\begin_inset Formula $-20\: km\leq z\leq0$
\end_inset

, while the creeping section (blue) extends from 
\begin_inset Formula $-40\: km\leq z\leq0$
\end_inset

.
 Along the line where the two sections coincide (
\begin_inset Formula $z=-20\: km$
\end_inset

), half of the coseismic displacement and half of the steady creep is applied
 (see 
\family typewriter
parameters/finalslip_rupture.spatialdb
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
parameters/sliprate_creep.spatialdb
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Boundary
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

conditions On the bottom boundary, vertical displacements are set to zero,
 while on the y-boundaries the x-displacements are set to zero.
 On the x-boundaries, the x-displacements are set to zero, while constant
 velocities of +/- 1 cm/yr are applied in the y-direction, giving a relative
 plate motion of 2 cm/year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Discretization For the graded3 mesh (
\family typewriter
meshes/spbm_hex8_graded4_20km.exo
\family default
), the resolution at the outer boundaries is 20 km.
 An inner region is then put through one level of refinement, so that near
 the center of the mesh the resolution is 10 km.
 All meshes were generated with Cubit.

\begin_layout Subsection
Running the Benchmark
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After checking out the benchmark files from the CIG SVN repository, change
 to the 
\family typewriter
meshes
\family default
 directory.
 Decompress the gzipped files in the 
\family typewriter
mesh
\family default
 directory,
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
gunzip *.gz
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, simply unzip the mesh you want to use (e.g., 
\family typewriter
meshes/spbm_hex8_graded3_20km.exo
\family default
).
 Change to the 
\family typewriter
parameters
\family default
 directory.
 There are a number of 
\family typewriter
.cfg
\family default
 files corresponding to the different meshes, as well as a 
\family typewriter
pylithapp.cfg
\family default
 file defining parameters common to all problems, and a 
\family typewriter
timedep.cfg
\family default
 file defining fault slip behavior and output frequency.
 Each problem uses three 
\family typewriter
.cfg
\family default
 files: 
\family typewriter
pylithapp.cfg
\family default
, a mesh-specific file (e.g., 
\family typewriter
spbm_hex8_graded3_20km.cfg
\family default
), and 
\family typewriter
timedep.cfg
\family default
.
 There are also scripts for each mesh.
 You can then run the problem either as
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
pylith spbm_hex8_graded3_20km.cfg timedep.cfg
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or as
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
sh ./spbm_hex8_graded3_20km.sh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will run the problem for 10 earthquake cycles of 200 years each, using
 a time-step size of 10 years, for a total simulation time of 2000 years.
 Ground surface output occurs every 10 years, while all other outputs occur
 every 50 years.
 The graded3 benchmark requires  approximately 5 GB of disk space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the problem has run, results will be placed in the 
\family typewriter
results
\family default
 directory in the mesh-specific subdirectory.
 These results may be viewed directly with a package such as ParaView; however,
 to compare results to the analytical solution, some postprocessing is required.
 First, generate the analytical results by going to the 
\family typewriter
utils
\family default
 directory and running the 
\family typewriter
savpres_ss.py
\family default
 script.
 This will produce comma-delimited files for displacements and velocities
 (
\family typewriter
savpres_displ.csv
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
savpres_vel.csv
\family default
) that are easy to use with a plotting package.
 There is an additional script in the 
\family typewriter
utils
\family default
 directory (
\family typewriter
vtkdiff.py
\family default
) that computes velocities from PyLith displacement results.
 To generate velocity results, you can type, for example,
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
./vtkdiff.py vtkdiff_hex8_graded3_20km.cfg
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results will be placed in the 
\family typewriter
results
\family default
 directory for the appropriate model.
 This will create a set of VTK files that you can use with ParaView.
 You can generate profile results using ParaView (e.g., the ``Plot Over Line''
 filter).
 By loading the entire time series for the ground surface velocity results,
 it is possible to generate profile results for all time steps.
 For comparison with the analytical results, it is easiest to use a profile
 coincident with the x-axis that extends from x=0 to the right-hand side
 of the mesh.
 The profiles can also be saved as CSV files from ParaView.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Benchmark Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:benchmark:savageprescott:solution"

\end_inset

 shows the computed surface displacements for the 10th earthquake cycle
 compared with the analytical solution.
 The profile results were obtained as described above, and then all results
 (analytical and numerical) were referenced to the displacements immediately
 following the last earthquake.
 We find very good agreement between the analytical and numerical solutions,
 even for meshes with uniform refinement.
 This is a relatively recent benchmark, and we have not yet explored quantitativ
e fits as a function of mesh resolution.
 For this benchmark, it is also important to consider the distance of the
 boundary from the region of interest.
 Also note that the agreement between analytical and numerical solutions
 is poor for early earthquake cycles, due to the differences in simulating
 the problem, as noted above.
