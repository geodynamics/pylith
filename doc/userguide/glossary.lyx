\begin_layout Description
sieve The sieve construction is a representation of the topology of the
 finite element mesh based upon a covering relation.
 For example, segments are covered by their endpoints, faces by their bounding
 edges, etc.
 Geometry is absent from the sieve, and is represented instead by a coordinate
 section.
 Sieves can also be understood as directed acyclic graphs, where we call
 the constituents points and arrows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
mesh A finite element mesh, used to partition space and provide support
 for the basis functions.
 It consists of a sieve and bundle of sections, including the coordinate
 section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
cell The highest dimensional elements of a mesh, or mesh entities of codimension
 zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
vertex The zero dimensional mesh elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
face Mesh elements that separate cells, or mesh entities of codimension
 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
field A parallel section which can be completed, or made consistent, across
 process boundaries.
 These are used to represent continuum fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
section These objects associate data to points in a sieve, which is equivalent
 to associating data to entities in a mesh.
 Like sieves, sections can also be understood as DAGs, with the points replaced
 by arrays of data and the arrows reversed.
 Sections may also be vectors, but are not limited to this.
 We use them to represent not only solution fields, but material property
 markers and boundary conditions.
 Sections must have restrict and update methods, which are allowable between
 any two points path-connected in the DAG.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
fiber\InsetSpace \space{}
dimension The topological dimension of the mesh, meaning the cell dimension.
 It can also mean the dimension of the space in which the mesh is embedded,
 but this is properly the embedding dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
cohesive\InsetSpace \space{}
cell A zero volume cell inserted between any two cells which shared
 a fault face.
 They are prisms with a fault face as the base.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
cone The set of mesh entities which cover any entity in a sieve.
 For example, the cone of a triangle is its three edges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
restrict The action of retrieving the values associated with a given mesh
 entity from a section.
 This is analogous to the restriction of a function to a subdomain.
 In finite element calculation, we restrict our global interpolant to an
 element in order to calculate the basis function coefficients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
support The set of mesh entities which are covered by any entity in a sieve.
 For example, the support of a triangle is the two tetrahedra it separates.
