Tutorials
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each tutorial is a self-contained lesson in how to use PyLith.
 The tutorials increase in degree of complexity from one to the next.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prerequisites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you begin any of the tutorials, you will need to install PyLith following
 the instructions in Chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

.

\color none
 For more complex tutorials, you will also need either CUBIT

cubit.sandia.gov

\end_inset

 or LaGriT

 mesh generation software to create the meshes.
 If you do not wish to create your own mesh at this time, the meshes are
 also provided as part of the tutorial.
 The ParaView

 visualization package may be used to view simulation results.
 ParaView 3 includes built-in documentation that is accessed by clicking
 on the Help menu item.
 Some additional documentation is available on the ParaView Wiki site

.
 You may use other visualization software, but some adaption from what is
 described here will be necessary.
 Furthermore, you can complete a subset of the tutorial using files provided
 (as described below), skipping the steps for which you do not have the
 proper software packages installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The files needed to work through the tutorials are found in the 
\family typewriter
examples
\family default
 directory under the top-level PyLith directory.
 There are five examples in 
\family typewriter
examples/twocells
\family default
, each consisting of just two cells (elements).
 These very simple examples make use of PyLith mesh ASCII format to define
 the mesh.
 This format is useful for understanding the basics of how PyLith works,
 since it is easy to create these files by hand.
 More complex problems, such as those found in 
\family typewriter
examples/3d
\family default
, use external mesh generation software to create the meshes.
 All of the files used in the example problems are extensively documented
 with comments.

\begin_layout Section
Additional Examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
examples
\family default
 directory also contains an example of using PyLith to compute Green's functions
 associated with slip at points on a fault surface in the 
\family typewriter
greensfns
\family default
 directory.
 The files associated with this example contain comments to explain how
 the simulation is setup.
 Once you understand the examples described in detail in the previous sections
 of this chapter, you should have little trouble understanding this additional
 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CIG subversion software repository 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://geodynamics.org/svn/cig/short/3D/PyLith/benchmarks/trunk
\end_layout

\end_inset

 contains input files for a number of community benchmarks.
 Most of the benchmarks include complete sets of PyLith input files.
 Some of the dynamic benchmarks do not include the mesh files because they
 are so large; instead they include the CUBIT journal files that can be
 used to generate the meshes.
