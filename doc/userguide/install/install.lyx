Installation and Getting Help
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Installation of PyLith on a desktop or laptop machine is, in most cases,
 very easy.
 Binary packages have been created for the most common platforms: Linux,
 Mac OS X, and Windows.
 Installation of PyLith on other operating systems -- or installation on
 a cluster -- requires building the software from the source code, which
 can be difficult for inexperienced users.
 We have created a small utility called PyLith Installer that makes installing
 PyLith and all of its dependencies from source much easier.
 Help is available from both a CIG mailing list and CIG Roundup Bug Tracking

\begin_layout Section
Installation from Source
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PyLith depends on a number of other packages (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:pylith-dependencies"

\end_inset

).
 This complicates building the software from the source code.
 In many cases some of the packages required by PyLith are available as
 binary packages.
 On the one hand, using the binary packages removes the burden of configuring,
 building, and installing these packages, but that can come with its own
 host of complications if consistent compiler and configuration settings
 are not used across all of the packages on which PyLith depends.
 This is usually not an issue with Linux distributions, such as Fedora,
 Ubuntu, and Debian that have good quality control; it can be an issue with
 Darwin package managers, such as Fink and MacPorts, where there is limited
 enforcement of consistency across packages.
 Nevertheless, PyLith can be built on most systems provided the instructions
 are followed carefully.
 PyLith is developed and tested on Linux and Mac OS X.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A small utility, PyLith Installer, removes most of the obstacles in building
 PyLith and its dependencies from source.
 For each package this utility downloads the source code, configures it,
 builds it, and installs it.
 This insures that the versions of the dependencies are consistent with
 PyLith and that the proper configure arguments are used.
 The minimum requirements for using the PyLith installer are a C compiler,
 
\family typewriter
tar
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
wget
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
curl
\family default
.
 Detailed instructions for how to install PyLith using the installer are
 included in the installer distribution, which is available from the PyLith

\begin_layout Section
Configuration on a Cluster
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are installing PyLith on a cluster with a batch system, you can configure
 Pyre such that the 
\family typewriter
pylith
\family default
 command automatically submits jobs to the batch queue.
 Pyre contains support for the LSF, PBS, SGE, and Globus batch systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command to submit a batch job depends upon the particular batch system
 used.
 Further, the command used in a batch script to launch an MPI program varies
 from one cluster to the next.
 This command can vary between two clusters, even if the clusters use the
 same batch system! On some systems, 
\family typewriter
mpirun
\family default
 is invoked directly from the batch script.
 On others, a special wrapper is used instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Properly configured, Pyre can handle job submissions automatically, insulating
 users from the details of the batch system and the site configuration.
 This feature has the most value when the system administrator installs
 a global Pyre configuration file on the cluster (under 
\family typewriter
/etc/pythia-0.8
\family default
), for the benefit of all users and all Pyre-based applications.

\end_inset

Launchers and Schedulers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have used one of the batch systems, you will know that the batch
 system requires you to write a script to launch a job.
 Fortunately, launching a parallel PyLith job is simplified by Pyre's 
\family typewriter
launcher
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
scheduler
\family default
 facilities.
 Many properties associated with 
\family typewriter
launcher
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
scheduler
\family default
 are pertinent to the cluster you are on, and are best customized in a configura
tion file.
 Your personal PyLith configuration file (
\family typewriter
~/.pyre/pylithapp/pylithapp.cfg
\family default
) is suitable for this purpose.
 On a cluster, the ideal setup is to install a system-wide configuration
 file under 
\family typewriter
/etc/pythia-0.8
\family default
, for the benefit of all users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pyre's 
\family typewriter
scheduler
\family default
 facility is used to specify the type of batch system you are using (if
 any):
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
[pylithapp]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
scheduler = lsf
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The valid values for 
\family typewriter
scheduler
\family default
 are 
\family typewriter
lsf
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
pbs
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
globus
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
none
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pyre's 
\family typewriter
launcher
\family default
 facility is used to specify which MPI implementation you are using:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
[pylithapp]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
launcher = mpich
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The valid values for 
\family typewriter
launcher
\family default
 include 
\family typewriter
mpich
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
lam-mpi
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may find the 
\family typewriter
dry
\family default
 option useful while debugging the 
\family typewriter
launcher
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
scheduler
\family default
 configuration.
 To debug the scheduler configuration, use the 
\family typewriter
--scheduler.dry
\family default
 option:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
pylith --scheduler.dry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option will cause PyLith to perform a ``dry run,'' dumping the batch
 script to the console, instead of actually submitting it for execution
 (the output is only meaningful if you're using a batch system).
 Likewise, to debug the launcher configuration, use the 
\family typewriter
--launcher.dry
\family default
 option:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
pylith --launcher.dry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option will cause PyLith to print the 
\family typewriter
mpirun
\family default
 command, instead of actually executing it.
 (If you're using a batch system, a job will be submitted for execution;
 when it runs, PyLith will simply print the 
\family typewriter
mpirun
\family default
 command, and the job will immediately terminate.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Running without a Batch System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a cluster without a batch system, you need to explicitly specify the
 machines on which the job will run.
 Supposing the machines on your cluster are named n001, n002, \SpecialChar \ldots{}
, etc., but
 you want to run the job on machines n001, n003, n004, and n005 (maybe n002
 is down for the moment).
 To run an example, create a file named 
\family typewriter
mymachines.cfg
\family default
 which specifies the machines to use:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
[pylithapp.launcher]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
nodegen = n%03d
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
nodelist = [1,3-5]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
nodegen
\family default
 property is a printf-style format string, used in conjunction with 
\family typewriter
nodelist
\family default
 to generate the list of machine names.
 The 
\family typewriter
nodelist
\family default
 property is a comma-separated list of machine names in square brackets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, invoke the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ pylith example.cfg mymachines.cfg
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This strategy gives you the flexibility to create an assortment of 
\family typewriter
.cfg
\family default
 files (with one 
\family typewriter
.cfg
\family default
 file for each machine list) which can be easily paired with different parameter
 files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your machine list does not change often, you may find it more convenient
 to specify default values for 
\family typewriter
nodegen
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
nodelist
\family default
 in 
\family typewriter
~/.pyre/pylithapp/pylithapp.cfg
\family default
 (which is read automatically).
 Then, you can run any simulation with no additional arguments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ pylith example.cfg
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\series bold
\color red
Warning:
\color inherit
 
\series default
\color none
This assumes your machine list has enough nodes for the simulation in question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will notice that a machine file 
\family typewriter
mpirun.nodes
\family default
 is generated.
 It will contain a list of the nodes where PyLith has run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Using a Batch System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The settings which are important when using a batch system are summarized
 in the sample configuration file which follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
[pylithapp]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
scheduler = lsf    ; the type of the installed batch system
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
[pylithapp.lsf]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
bsub-options = [-a mpich_gm]    ; special options for 'bsub'
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
[pylithapp.launcher]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
command = mpirun.lsf    ; 'mpirun' command to use on our cluster
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
[pylithapp.job]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
queue = normal    ; default queue for jobs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These settings are usually placed in 
\family typewriter
~/.pyre/pylithapp/pylithapp.cfg
\family default
 or in a system-wide configuration file.
 They can be overridden on the command line, where one typically specifies
 the job name and the allotted time for the job:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ pylith example1.cfg --job.queue=debug 
\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    --job.name=example1 --job.walltime=5*minute 
\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    --nodes=4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of processors to allocate for the job is given using the 
\family typewriter
nodes
\family default
 parameter.
\end_layout
