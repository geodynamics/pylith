About This Document
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is organized into two parts.
 The first part begins with an introduction to PyLith and discusses the
 types of problems that PyLith can solve and how to run the software; the
 second part provides appendices and references.

\begin_layout Section
Who Will Use This Documentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This documentation is aimed at two categories of users: scientists who prefer
 to use prepackaged and specialized analysis tools, and experienced computationa
l Earth scientists.
 Of the latter, there are likely to be two classes of users: those who just
 run models, and those who modify the source code.
 Users who modify the source are likely to have familiarity with scripting,
 software installation, and programming, but are not necessarily professional
 programmers.

 is making this source code available to you at no cost in hopes that the
 software will enhance your research in geophysics.
 A number of individuals have contributed a significant portion of their
 careers toward the development of this software.
 It is essential that you recognize these individuals in the normal scientific
 practice by citing the appropriate peer-reviewed papers and making appropriate
 acknowledgements in talks and publications.
 At this time there are no refereed journal articles discussing the design
 and implementation of PyLith, so we request that you cite four AGU meeting
 abstracts associated with PyLith:
