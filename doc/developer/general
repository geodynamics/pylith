Guiding Principles for PyLith code

1. Document your header files in Doxygen format. Include a description
for EVERY method, member, and argument to a member function.

2. Class definitions go in header files (.hh), class implementations
go in .cc files, and inline methods go in .icc files. Use an include
directive in header files for inline methods.

3. Files checked in to the repository trunk should at least compile.

4. C++ and Python classes should have corresponding unit tests in
libtests and pytests. High-level functionality should be verified
using a full-scale test.
