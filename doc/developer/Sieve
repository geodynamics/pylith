Notes on Sieve

* Depth/height

  In general, vertices are at a depth of 0 and cells are at the
  maximum depth. Similarly, cells are at a height of 0 and vertices
  are at the maximum depth.

  For a 3-D mesh with vertices, edges, faces, and cells:

               Depth  Height
    vertices   0      3
    edges      1      2
    faces      2      1
    cells      3      0

  For a boundary mesh, we currently store the full set (vertices,
  edges, faces, and cells). Obviously for 2-D meshes, the boundary
  mesh doesn't contain "volume" cells, but just vertices, edges, and
  faces. This means the "boundary" cells are at a height of 1 and
  maximum depth - 1 .

  The fault mesh is generated with its own numbering, so it is
  different and it only contains vertices and "faces" where "faces"
  means faces for a 3-D mesh and edges for a 2-D mesh.


* Fiber dimension

  Fiber dimension refers to the number of values at a point.

* Section/Field

  Sections generally refer to the Sieve data structure, whereas Fields
  refer to a vector field. The PyLith Field class stores a vector
  field over vertices or cells.
