\section{Point Numbering}

    In PyLith, we choose to use integers to refer to Sieve points. Thus, we are left with the task of assigning
semantics to certain ranges. Without this, debugging becomes quite difficult and quick range checks qould be replaced by
costly depth checks in many algorithms.

    The first assumption, also present in much of Sieve itself, is that cells are numbered first, followed by vertices,
and then all other intermediate topological pieces, such as edges and faces. This simple scheme is enough for most
applications, however the introduction of faults and cohesive cells in PyLith poses additional problems.

    When faults are introduced, we must also assign numbers to three more types of topological pieces:
\begin{itemize}
  \item cohesive cells

  \item new fault vertices, which are duplicate vertices on the far side of the fault

  \item Lagrange vertices, which implement Lagrange multiplier constraints
\end{itemize}
Before creating the faults, we know only the number of vertices in each fault group. Currently, we number new fault
vertices in a block, the the Lagrange vertices, and then cohesive cells. In each division, the new points for each fault
are numbered contiguously. Sieve viewers use a variant depth label, ``censored depth'', to exclude some points from the
output. The censored depth is computed by rejecting both the Lagrange vertices and cohesive cells.

\section{Point Depth and Height}

    In general, vertices are at a depth of 0 and cells are at the maximum depth. Similarly, cells are at a height of 0
and vertices are at the maximum depth. Notice that depth and height correspond the the usual dimension and
codimension. For a 3-D mesh with vertices, edges, faces, and cells:

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
               & Depth & Height \\
\hline
    vertices   &   0   &   3 \\
    edges      &   1   &   2 \\
    faces      &   2   &   1 \\
    cells      &   3   &   0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Depth and height of various topological pieces.}
\end{table}

  For a boundary mesh, we currently store the full set (vertices,
  edges, faces, and cells). Obviously for 2-D meshes, the boundary
  mesh doesn't contain "volume" cells, but just vertices, edges, and
  faces. This means the "boundary" cells are at a height of 1 and
  maximum depth - 1 .

  The fault mesh is generated with its own numbering, so it is
  different and it only contains vertices and "faces" where "faces"
  means faces for a 3-D mesh and edges for a 2-D mesh.

\section{Sections}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Fiber dimension

  Fiber dimension refers to the number of values at a point.

  \item Section/Field

  Sections generally refer to the Sieve data structure, whereas Fields
  refer to a vector field. The PyLith Field class stores a vector
  field over vertices or cells.
\end{itemize}
