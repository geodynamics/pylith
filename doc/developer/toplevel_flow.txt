Top-Level Flow of PyLith

pylith "main"

  The pylith Python script creates a PyLithApp object, which controls
  the flow of the code.

problem

  The type of PyLith simulation is known as a "problem". Currently,
  only time-dependent problems are solved. The TimeDependent.run()
  method controls the time-stepping with quasi-static time-stepping
  handled by the Implicit object and the dynamic time-stepping handled
  by the Explicit object.
