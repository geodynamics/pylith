INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING PYLITH ON THE CALTECH LINUX CLUSTER PANGU
======================================================================

These instructions are nearly identical to those in
Cluster_CIT-garuda.txt. As a result, we only mention those settings
which differ.
 
See the files in the Cluster_CIT-pangu directory for the settings used
to setup the environment variables using the bash shell. The
$TOOLS_FORMAT environment variable is used to differentiate between
packages built with different compilers and/or different optimization
settings. In this case, TOOLS_FORMAT is intel-11.1. Because this is a
cluster the tools are built for production runs using
high-optimization level. You should setup your environment BEFORE
building the packages.

We use the Intel 11.1 compiler and MKL math libraries. These are in
  /opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/072/
  /opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/072/mkl/lib

We use OpenMPI version 1.4.2 installed in
  /opt/openmpi/1.4.2/intel
