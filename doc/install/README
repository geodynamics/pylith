If you are new to PyLith, we recommend using the PyLith binary
distributions to get up and running quickly. Once you are familiar
with PyLith and want a custom installation, then we recommend that you
use the PyLith Installer to build PyLith and its dependencies. The
PyLith Installer is available on the PyLith website
http://www.geodynamics.org/cig/software/pylith/. Instructions for how
to use the installer are bundled in its distribution.
