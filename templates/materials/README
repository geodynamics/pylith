PyLith interface files are installed to $PREFIX/shared/pylith/swig.

Functions in bulk material routines are called for every quadrature
point of every cell of the material, so efficient code is essential.

The consistency checks of user input should throw exceptions with a
meaningful error message so that the user can fix the
mistake. Consistency checks in the other routines should use the
assert() macro so that they can be removed during compilation. To
remove the assert() calls during compilation configure with -DNDEBUG
added to the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environment variables.
