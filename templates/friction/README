Overview

  This directory contains source files for building a user defined
  fault constitutive model component consisting of C++ code, a Python
  module, and Python code. The example implementation provides viscous
  (slip rate proportional) friction. State variables are used to hold
  the slip rate. Note that state variables are not needed in this
  case, but we use them in this example to illustrate how to use state
  variables in a fault constitutive model.

  The suggested path to customizing this component is to build and
  install the provided ViscousFriction component and then rename/copy
  the files and gradually adopt it to your specific needs. For more
  complex bulk rheologies, you may want to use the SlipWeakening or
  RateStateAgeing components provided with PyLith as templates.



Requirements

  In order to build the component and interface it with PyLith, you will need
    * C++ compiler
    * SWIG (version 1.3.33 or later)
    * Python with header files (version 2.3 or later)
    * autoconf tools

  The C++ compiler must be compatible with the installed Python and
  both must be compatible with the C++ compiler and Python used to
  build PyLith. The safest way to insure compatibility is to use the
  C++ compiler and Python provided with your operating system and
  build PyLith from source. However, on many systems it should be
  possible to build the component using g++ and have it work with
  PyLith installed from a binary package.

How to build/install the ViscousFriction component

  1. Run "autoreconf -if" in this directory (templates/friction).

  2. Run configure either from this directory or a scratch build
  directory. Use the --prefix=DIRECTORY to indicate where the files
  should be installed. We strongly recommend that you install the
  component to the same location as where PyLith is installed. For
  example, if PyLith is installed in $HOME/cig then use the
  --prefix=$HOME/cig command line argument to configure. To build in a
  separate directory simply invoke the configure script from the other
  directory. For example, from $HOME/build/pylith-contrib run
  $HOME/src/pylith/templates/friction/configure --prefix=$HOME/cig.

  Configure will check for a number of files including the location of
  PyLith C++ header files, library, and SWIG interface files. You
  may need to define some additional command line arguments to
  configure and/or environment variables to help configure find the
  required files.

  We run configure using on a MacBook Pro using MacPorts where we have
  defined a number of environment variables in .bashrc for installed
  tools.

  ${HOME}/src/cig/pylith/templates/friction/configure  \
    --prefix=${CIG_DIR}  \
    CPPFLAGS="-I${PROJ4_INCDIR} -I${PORTS_INCDIR} -I${CIG_INCDIR}"  \
    LDFLAGS="-L${PROJ4_LIBDIR} -L${PORTS_LIBDIR} -L${CIG_LIBDIR} -F${PORTS_DIR}/Library/Frameworks"  \
    PYLITH_SWIG_DIR="${CIG_DIR}/share/pylith/swig" CC=gcc CXX=g++


  3. Run "make", "make install", and "make check" from the top-level
  build directory. This will first build the C++ library and module,
  then install the files to the location specified by the --prefix
  command line argument to configure, and finally run some Python
  tests to verify that the ViscousFriction component was installed
  correctly.

Customization

  This is where the fun begins. Read over the Python and C++ source
  code to become familiar with the features implemented with the
  ViscousFriction component. The ViscousFriction Python object
  simply defines what fields are available for output (properties in
  the info files and state variables stress and strain in data files
  at a given time in a simulation. The ViscousFriction C++ object
  does the grunt work of computing the various quantities required for
  computing the coefficient of friction. The interface for the fault
  constitutive models has been designed to be simple and use arrays
  rather than complex C++ data structures. This reduces speed slightly
  but makes it much easier to implement new constitutive models.

  We recommend that you start by changing the constitutive equations,
  followed by changing the properties and state variables.

Hints

  Functions in friction model routines are called for every fault
  vertex, so efficient code is important. Having said that, get the
  implementation correct first and then worry about speed.

  The consistency checks of user input should throw exceptions with a
  meaningful error message so that the user can fix the
  mistake. Consistency checks in the other routines should use the
  assert() macro so that they can be removed during compilation. To
  remove the assert() calls during compilation configure with -DNDEBUG
  added to the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environment variables.
