	* [r4625] Added 'utils' to build; deleted lowercase
	  "utils/makefile" which interfered.

2006-09-25 20:41  willic3

	* [r4614] Initial version of driver routine for traction BC. The
	  driver is being used for consistency with other routines, which
	  have been designed for the eventual addition of
	  large-deformation versions. It is also envisioned that this
	  routine will be called from within the iteration loop, which
	  will also allow for eventually adding large deformations.

2006-09-25 19:53  willic3

	* [r4613] Created routine to generate coordinate-independent
	  surface integration info for a linear tet.

2006-09-25 19:31  willic3

	* [r4612] Fixed incorrect variable used for nodes per face.

	  writing traction BC.

2006-09-25 18:13  willic3

	* [r4602] Added integration info for surface elements. Entries are
	  present for quadratic elements even though they are not
	  supported at present.

2006-09-25 17:34  willic3

	* [r4601] Made some changes to allow traction BC.

2006-09-22 15:50  willic3

2006-09-10 03:05  willic3

	* [r4507] Added additional blockrot code that works with present
	  auxiliary fault file. Once we settle on formats, these codes
	  will be merged. Added entries to makefiles.

2006-09-06 21:30  willic3

	* [r4486] Added initial version of blockrot2 program, which still
	  needs to be tested and possibly debugged. This code takes UCD
	  and auxiliary fault info from LaGriT, as well as a parameter
	  file, and creates split node input from block rotation info.
	  Also added sample parameter file and entries in Makefile.am and
	  makefile.

2006-09-06 00:40  baagaard

	* [r4478] Tutorial. Made tutor.py executable.

2006-09-06 00:25  baagaard

2006-09-05 03:24  knepley

	* [r4468] Now bm1b works in serial for me

2006-09-04 22:19  knepley

	* [r4467] Now comiling with new Sieve

2006-08-29 16:37  baagaard

	  page.

2006-08-28 01:11  willic3

	* [r4439] Altered routine, bindings and calls to include missing
	  array (nprint).

2006-08-26 22:39  sue

	* [r4438] added edited lyx files

2006-08-25 22:57  sue

	* [r4435] added lyx file and all files edited

	  splitcube visualizations to use y-disp (only meaningful
	  component.

2006-08-24 22:29  baagaard

	* [r4425] Switched from copyfile() to copy() to preserve
	  permissions on executable scripts.

2006-08-24 22:22  sue

	* [r4423] added lyx file

2006-08-24 22:10  baagaard

	* [r4422] Fixed bug in ReadBounary_PyLith where units were ignored
	  incorrectly. The line with displacement units is read as the
	  last thing in IgnoreComments_PyLith (which causes it to stop).
	  Fix is to remove line reading displacement units.

2006-08-24 21:27  baagaard

	* [r4421] Fixed bug in scanner wherein iIgnoreComments_PyLith
	  didn't terminate on encountering '\0'. This brings the ignore
	  comments functionality in line with what is in meshpylith.c in
	  PETSc.

2006-08-24 20:56  baagaard

	* [r4420] Created utils/Makefile.am. Updated configure.ac
	  accordingly.

2006-08-24 18:35  baagaard

	* [r4413] User guide. Added not on compiler bug in gcc-4.1.

2006-08-24 15:10  willic3

	* [r4412] Added new blockrot.f code to compute split node
	  displacements corresponding to given block rotations, using the
	  UCD output from LaGriT, and updated the makefile to include the
	  new code. Increased the dimensions on makeucd.f to handle some
	  of the bigger meshes.

2006-08-23 23:27  baagaard

	* [r4409] User guide. Brought splitcube up to date. Added figures
	  for splitcube tutorial.

2006-08-23 23:19  sue

	* [r4402] Added files for splitsube tutorial.

2006-08-22 21:44  baagaard

	* [r4401] Changed name of splittest to splitcube.

2006-08-22 21:42  baagaard

	* [r4400] Continued docbook to LaTeX conversion. Cleaned up
	  fileformats.

2006-08-22 15:30  baagaard

	* [r4398] First stab at converting docbook files to LaTeX.

2006-08-21 14:49  willic3

	* [r4393] Changed readucd2.par to conform to new version of
	  readucd2 code. Added makeucd utility to makefile.

2006-08-18 21:34  knepley

	* [r4392] Activated matrix preallocation in serial - This will
	  break parallel code right now

2006-08-18 21:13  willic3

	* [r4391] Changed the way I deal with faults, which was wrong
	  before. At present, the UCD file needs to contain one nodal
	  attribute and one element attribute per fault, to allow for
	  nodes and elements that lie on more than one fault. This still
	  does not solve the problem when a node/element pair lie on more
	  than one fault, which can not be handled with split or slippery
	  nodes anyway. The problem of duplicate entries will have to be
	  dealt with somehow in postprocessing. Also added in options for
	  reading fault normals if they are available. The accompanying
	  parameter file needs to be updated.

2006-08-15 21:59  knepley

	* [r4299] Fixed prototype

2006-08-12 20:45  knepley

	* [r4277] Now split nodes seem to work

	* [r4276] Looks like its working in parallel now

2006-08-04 22:14  knepley

	* [r4229] Fix mesh viewer name

2006-08-04 20:51  willic3

	* [r4227] Initial version of code to turn UCD pieces from
	  LithoMop/PyLith into complete UCD files. All behavior is
	  controlled by command-line arguments including options for
	  interpolating state variables to nodes and averaging Gauss point
	  values to element centroids. The code definitely needs more
	  testing. So far, it produces a valid UCD file and the results
	  look reasonable, but no quantitative testing has been done.
	  Likely future enhancements include the ability to deal with
	  binary UCD files.

2006-08-04 19:18  knepley

	* [r4226] Fixed ALE::Point refrences to Sieve points

2006-08-03 19:39  willic3

	* [r4219] Initial (unfinished) version of code to create complete
	  UCD files out of pieces created by LithoMop and PyLith. Includes
	  options to interpolate stresses to nodes and average stresses to
	  Gauss points. Current limitations: Only works for linear hexes
	  and tets. Only works for ASCII UCD format. Somewhat primitive
	  stress interpolation algorithm.

2006-08-01 16:48  knepley

	* [r4187] Changes which allow serial running with new Sieve fields

2006-07-20 14:33  willic3

	* [r4039] Dimension parameters have been changed to deal with the
	  high resolution benchmarks.

2006-07-18 21:55  cassie

	* [r4025] just testing

2006-07-14 17:47  knepley

	* [r4019] Small fix

	* [r4018] Updates for new Sieve stuff

2006-07-13 15:22  willic3

	* [r4015] Updated file to reflect actual values used for BM5.

2006-07-13 02:23  willic3

	* [r4014] Fixed stupid indexing error.

2006-07-12 21:51  willic3

	* [r4013] Added utilities and sample parameter files, as well as a
	  README containing brief code descriptions. The scaling codes are
	  simple and appear to work OK. The readucd2 code has been tested
	  on a single example (BM5 created with LaGriT) and appears to
	  work OK, but more testing is probably needed. I still need to
	  make this whole directory part of the GNU build procedure and
	  install the executables.

2006-07-11 19:02  willic3

	* [r4004] Added new version of faultcalc that uses essentially no
	  memory. This code should be at least as efficient as the
	  previous version, and relies only on the presence of the .fbc
	  and .fcoord files created by readucd or readnetgen, as well as a
	  parameter file.

2006-07-11 17:50  willic3

	* [r4003] Two utility codes that were previously available only
	  with the tutorial have been added to the repository.

2006-07-11 17:49  willic3

	* [r4002] Update code to more recent version that includes
	  features such as getting BC directly from an auxiliary values
	  file.

2006-07-07 14:48  willic3

	* [r3980] Kludgy fix for the case where Sieve produces an empty
	  split node file. In this case the file does not contain an EOF
	  and an error would ordinarily be returned.

2006-07-05 23:40  baagaard

	* [r3921] User guide. Fixed mercurial version number.

2006-07-05 23:19  baagaard

2006-07-03 20:36  baagaard

	* [r3911] Tutorial. Converted runbm5 from bash script to Python
	  script. Changed name to runbm. This removes dependency on bash
	  shell for running a job.

2006-07-03 19:38  baagaard

	* [r3910] Tutorial. Finished converting tutor shell script to
	  Python. This removed reliance on bash shell for tutor.

2006-07-03 16:24  baagaard

	* [r3909] Created tutorials subdir with input files (don't include
	  sim output). reversenog is the old bm5.

2006-06-30 21:52  baagaard

	* [r3907] User guide. Fixed fault dimensions in tutorialbm5.

2006-06-30 17:13  willic3

	* [r3906] Increased max dimensions for readnetgen and changed some
	  makefile options. Need to create a Makefile.am for these codes
	  and make all utilities part of the GNU build procedure.

2006-06-28 17:58  willic3

	* [r3905] Removed blank line that makes parser blow up.

2006-06-28 16:59  willic3

	* [r3879] Updated license headers to MIT license using my
	  'licencetool' Perl script.

2006-06-24 00:31  leif

	* [r3878] Minor tweak to 'configure': Pythia's MPI packages are
	  not actually required.

2006-06-24 00:20  leif

	* [r3877] Added boilerplate GNU-style text info files: AUTHORS,
	  INSTALL, ChangeLog, COPYING, NEWS, README. "ChangeLog" generated
	  with svn2cl (http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/svn2cl/) using the
	  following command: svn log --xml | xsltproc --stringparam
	  include-rev yes ~/install/svn2cl-0.3/svn2cl.xsl - > ChangeLog

	* [r3868] Changed mpiexec to mpirun. People without mpirun will
	  need to fix things with a symbolic link.

2006-06-23 15:52  willic3

	* [r3867] Added shell scripts to run example problem.

2006-06-23 15:47  willic3

2006-06-23 14:29  willic3

	* [r3857] Put in simple shell scripts to run the problem based on
	  Brad's script. We probably still need to put in something like a
	  'make clean'.

2006-06-23 13:50  willic3

2006-06-21 02:10  willic3

	* [r3830] I left off the units in the field descriptions, which
	  caused ParaView to barf. This has been fixed. It should already
	  be correct for binary UCD output.

2006-06-21 01:42  knepley

	* [r3829] Fixed assembly of full_displacements from increments
	  Fixed residu() to not overwrite the solution

	* [r3805] Fixed bug where package was still called Lithomop3D.
	  This caused the module to be put in the wrong directory.

2006-06-15 17:13  willic3

	* [r3804] Commented out a debugging line.
	* [r3803] It appears that the fix for getting the correct residual
	  vector in parallel is to first zero the entries, then use
	  ADD_VALUES with assembleVectorComplete. This fix in these
	  routines now appears to give the correct solution for bm1b in
	  both serial and parallel runs for the elastic and time-dependent
	  solutions.

2006-06-14 23:49  baagaard

2006-06-06 21:33  willic3

	* [r3762] Updated bindings for use of Ielindx array as well as
	  updating some other stuff. The bindings will need to be
	  double-checked.
	* [r3761] Updated bindings to use Ielindx array as well as fixing
	  some older stuff that had not been updated. This will need to be
	  checked.

	* [r3748] Example problem with 2 materials.

2006-06-02 01:50  knepley

	* [r3740] I now use the original element number indxiel(elem) in
	  the call to assembleMatrix() - This means I have to preserve the
	  indxiel array

2006-06-01 03:41  knepley

	* [r3739] Fixed injection of boundary values in visualization

2006-05-29 19:02  knepley

	  This should be correct, but hasn't been tested.

2006-05-15 23:32  willic3

	* [r3585] Changed things so elements are referenced by number
	  rather than order in a file.

2006-05-15 23:23  willic3

	* [r3584] Changed code so that coordinates are indexed by node
	  number rather than order in the file.

	* [r2757] More name changes.

2006-04-13 18:21  willic3

	* [r2756] Changing names from lithomop to pylith.

2006-04-13 18:14  willic3

	* [r2755] Moved top-level lithomop3d directory to pylith3d. This
	  is probably an inefficient way of doing it.

2006-04-12 22:54  leif

	* [r2752] Moved lithomop-sieve -> PyLith/trunk.

2006-04-11 19:32  willic3

	* [r2736] Changed some names.

2006-04-11 19:30  willic3

	* [r2735] Updated code for other altered components.

2006-04-11 19:29  willic3

	* [r2734] Simplified looping by making elemFamilies a list of
	  dictionaries.

2006-04-11 18:55  willic3

	* [r2729] Simplified things by making elemFamilies a list of
	  dictionaries.

2006-04-11 15:42  willic3

	* [r2723] Beginnings of an ElemFamilies class. This will
	  essentially provide a bunch of functions for looping over
	  families. The present implementation that uses a dictionary to
	  store the elemFamilies info seems a bit clumsy.

2006-04-11 15:07  willic3

	* [r2722] Updated the way elements and element families are dealt
	  with. At present, the elements dictionary contains dimension
	  info as well as the element nodes array and arrays containing
	  the element type and material ID for each element. These arrays
	  are only needed until the elements are placed into families.

2006-04-10 20:48  willic3

	* [r2719] More fixing. Code is still incomplete. At present, it
	  returns an elements dictionary and an elementFamilies
	  dictionary. Still need to figure out where to put stuff for
	  sorting elements into families.

2006-04-07 15:41  willic3

	* [r2685] Attempted to merge in Leif's changes from trunk for
	  building the examples. These will need to be checked to make
	  sure I haven't mixed up or left out any files.

2006-04-03 19:47  willic3

	* [r2667] Did a hand-merge of Leif's changes from trunk. This will
	  need to be tested.

2006-04-03 14:56  willic3

	* [r2662] Checked in some incomplete changes just to get them in
	  before Leif switches the repository.

2006-04-03 14:55  willic3

	* [r2661] Checked in some incomplete changes just to get them in
	  before Lief switches the repository.

2006-03-29 19:41  leif

	* [r2657] Merged walter's r2653 from trunk: changed externals from
	  svn:// to http://.

2006-03-29 16:44  willic3

	* [r2656] Merged in Leif's character string fixes from trunk.

2006-03-29 15:03  willic3

	* [r2655] Finished incomplete merge from trunk.

2006-03-28 16:22  willic3

	* [r2649] Merged in Leif's changes from trunk.

2006-03-28 16:18  willic3

2006-03-28 16:16  willic3

	* [r2646] Merged in Leif's changes from trunk.

2006-03-28 15:47  willic3

	* [r2645] Merged in Leif's changes from trunk.

2006-03-28 15:28  willic3

	* [r2644] Merged in Leif's changes from trunk. These will need to
	  be tested.

2006-03-23 22:45  willic3

	* [r2641] Put meshimporter into the inventory, so the element
	  family can get info from it. Started (but didn't finish) an
	  initialize function. Moved all the material stuff out of
	  __init__. Added elemInfoSolid (empty dictionary) and stateVars
	  to __init__. Put in a matProps dictionary into __init__. This
	  still needs a lot of work (and a lot more functions).

2006-03-23 22:25  willic3

	* [r2640] Added elemType to elemFamily dictionary, even though at
	  present all elements in the mesh must have the same element
	  type. Also added a pointer to the element family material model,
	  which for Tecton-style input will be deduced from an integer ID
	  in the connectivity file.

2006-03-23 21:35  willic3

	* [r2639] Fixed capitalization.

2006-03-23 21:17  willic3

	* [r2638] Added function pointers for bmatrix and getshape that
	  are dependent on whether b-bar integration is being used.

2006-03-23 21:04  willic3

	* [r2637] What I have for a Material class so far.

2006-03-23 19:28  willic3

	* [r2636] Initial version of a class for an isotropic linear
	  elastic material, derived from class Material. There are no
	  additional functions other than __init__, where all dimensions a
	  function pointers are assigned.

2006-03-22 17:08  willic3

	* [r2635] Rough outline of ElemFamilySolid class, with lots of
	  missing pieces. I need to finsh putting in the objects for the
	  family, and define all the necessary operations.

2006-03-20 17:15  willic3

	* [r2634] Initial version of a class (really just one function)
	  that defines properties for a given element type. This includes
	  number of nodes per element (and related info) as well as
	  integration information. The results are returned in a
	  dictionary.

2006-03-17 21:04  willic3

	* [r2633] Beginnings of an ElemFamily class. Some of the stuff
	  that I originally had in there needs to go in an ElemFamilySolid
	  class. I also need to determine which default functions should
	  be required. Presumably, the things that might inherit from this
	  class are: 1. ElemFamilySolid: This is top priority, and
	  includes all solid elements. 2. ElemFamilySurface: This is
	  moderate priority, and is needed primarily for traction BC. 3.
	  ElemFamilyFault: This probably won't happen for a while
	  (possibly never if we change our minds again about how to
	  implement faults). Also, this may be subdivided into kinematic
	  and dynamic categories.

2006-03-14 23:02  willic3

	* [r2632] Added some more stuff to SolverQSState, assuming
	  everything is done using PETSc. The code presently uses Matt's
	  functions for creating and destroying the main stiffness matrix
	  and 2 vectors, contained in scanner.cc.

2006-03-12 01:19  knepley

	* [r2631] Fixed CoSifter interface

2006-03-11 21:25  knepley

	* [r2630] Added some PyLith documentation

2006-03-06 20:26  willic3

	* [r2629] Merged in Leif's bindings fixes, as well as his revised
	  exception handler. Also included his changes in
	  lithomop3dmodule.cc, even though I have not yet included his
	  build system changes.

2006-02-28 22:14  knepley

	* [r2628] Added refinement code to scanner

2006-02-28 13:29  knepley

	* [r2627] Small fix

2006-02-28 11:53  willic3

	* [r2626] Changed UCD output labels.

2006-02-28 09:17  knepley

	* [r2625] Lots of debugging Fixed Petsc init

2006-02-28 06:19  willic3

	* [r2624] Fixed mangled input files.

2006-02-28 00:40  knepley

	* [r2623] More PETSc changes

2006-02-27 20:53  willic3

	* [r2622] Created quick and dirty code to convert PyLith format to
	  UCD.

2006-02-27 17:30  willic3

	* [r2621] Changed behavior so existing output files are
	  overwritten.

2006-02-27 06:44  knepley

	* [r2620] Fixed declarations

2006-02-27 06:13  knepley

	* [r2619] New Mesh interface from PETSc

2006-02-22 19:07  willic3

	* [r2616] Minor changes to SolverState definition. The stuff
	  related to faults and element families has been removed. The
	  solver state now only contains force and displacement vectors,
	  along with stiffness matrix stuff. Still to be determined is how
	  this should really be organized. The present 'stiff' object
	  actually includes 3 PETSc objects (matrix and 2 vectors). It
	  would probably be better to have a single solverState container
	  with all force and displacement vectors, along with the
	  stiffness matrix. It seems likely they should also all be PETSc
	  Vecs or Mats.

2006-02-17 22:24  willic3

	* [r2613] Very minor updates -- I may actually use a different
	  method of dealing with vectors, etc., than the PETSc bindings
	  Brad is using.

2006-02-17 22:23  willic3

	* [r2612] Very rough initial stab at solver state definition.
	  There is a problem because state variables should actually
	  belong to element families.

2006-02-14 22:21  willic3

	* [r2601] Initial sketch of quasi-static solver, which is
	  presently missing most functions it will need.

2006-02-14 20:28  willic3

	* [r2599] Initial version of a Solver base class that is based
	  entirely on Brad Aagaard's EqSim version. Some of the functions
	  may not be necessary for my case, and this relies on the
	  petscutil package, which is not yet checked in to svn (and may
	  not be updated for the current version of PETSc).

2006-02-14 19:25  willic3

	* [r2598] Moved obsolete directory to 'previous'.

2006-02-14 19:22  willic3

	* [r2597] Removed directory containing duplicate/obsolete files.

2006-02-14 16:59  willic3

	* [r2596] Removed temporary file.

2006-02-14 16:57  willic3

	* [r2595] Committing files that were not previously committed.

2006-02-14 16:54  willic3

	* [r2594] Moved current working versions of files to 'pyre'
	  directory. That way, these will not conflict with current
	  functioning code in 'lithomop3d' directory.

2006-02-14 16:50  willic3

	* [r2593] These old files have all been moved to the 'previous'
	  directory.

2006-02-14 16:48  willic3

	* [r2592] Moved current working versions of files to 'pyre'
	  directory. That way, these will not conflict with current
	  functioning code in 'lithomop3d' directory.

2006-02-14 16:44  willic3

	* [r2591] Initial versions of Solver and SimulationController.

2006-02-14 16:42  willic3

	* [r2590] These old files have all been moved to the 'previous'
	  directory.
	* [r2589] These old files have all been moved to the 'previous'
	  directory.

2006-02-14 16:34  willic3

	* [r2588] Created a directory to hold stuff that was previously in
	  pyre. The revised pyre directory will only hold the current
	  versions of files.

2006-02-06 01:15  knepley

	* [r2587] Moved to new Sieve interface

2006-02-02 22:11  willic3

	* [r2579] Changed a few items in the mesh object dictionaries to
	  correspond to what is now in MeshImporterTecton.py. Some names
	  were changed to be more clear, and the elemFamily dictionary was
	  made much simpler (just number of families and an array
	  containing the number of elements in each family). The material
	  stuff was removed from the mesh object. We still need to figure
	  out how to associate material info with element group number.

2006-02-02 22:08  willic3

	* [r2578] Merged in most of Brad's suggested changes, and finished
	  _getElems function. For now, I avoided the dilemma of needing to
	  know the number of element families before initially scanning
	  the file by locally defining a maximum possible number. If this
	  is exceeded, and error is returned. The number of element
	  families is now equal to the number of different group numbers
	  encountered in the input file. A little new logic will be
	  required to pack the overdimensioned array containing the number
	  of elements in each family into the properly-dimensioned array.
	  This will be done in routine read_connect.

2006-02-01 23:07  willic3

	* [r2577] Slight update to mesh importing: Default fileRoot is
	  passed in as an argument, and specific filenames can be
	  overridden by the package inventory. Still need to figure out
	  how to get most of the material stuff out of here. A comment
	  section has been added mentioning possible options.

2006-01-31 19:47  willic3

	* [r2572] Removed almost everything so that the generic
	  MeshImporter is very basic.

2006-01-31 19:46  willic3

	* [r2571] Put in a list to define the number of nodes per element
	  type. This really isn't part of the mesh object and probably
	  shouldn't go here.

2006-01-31 19:45  willic3

	* [r2570] More updates for mesh importing. Code still isn't
	  finished and some parts are incorrect.

2006-01-31 17:16  willic3

	* [r2567] Updated, but still incomplete, version of code to get
	  mesh object using Tecton-style input.

2006-01-30 22:02  willic3

	* [r2562] More work on format-specific code to import a mesh. The
	  code is still incomplete and I should make sure I initialize all
	  variables.

2006-01-30 22:01  willic3

	* [r2561] Trivial change to update runtime info output. This
	  module will need to be extensively modified (or abandoned) to
	  account for change in the rest of the top-level code.

2006-01-30 21:30  willic3

	* [r2559] Removed some stuff so this makes more sense, after
	  e-mail from Brad. There is virtually nothing in here now.

2006-01-28 02:36  willic3

	* [r2558] Initial (unfinished) ingredients for a mesh object and
	  facilities for importing it.

2006-01-11 18:13  knepley

	* [r2556] Fixed argument to createPETScMat() Upgraded scanner and
	  sparse to new Mesh Added Sieve path to Makefile.am Fixed typo in
	  iterate

2005-12-15 21:42  willic3

	* [r2534] Replaced sieve sections with a call to modified addstf
	  for routines that already had sieve, and added modified call for
	  those that didn't already have it. Calling routines include a
	  C-style index for element number (ielgpetsc) that is passed to
	  addstf. The addstf routine accepts the lmx array (for slippery
	  nodes) but does not yet do anything with it. Additional logic
	  will be needed in addstf to deal with the extra degrees of
	  freedom and the routine in scanner.cc will need to be modified
	  to increase the fiber bundle size.

2005-12-15 20:13  willic3

	* [r2532] Updated routine to use Sieve, similarly to
	  elas_matinit_cmp_ss.F.

2005-12-15 20:05  willic3

	* [r2530] Updated routine to use Sieve, similarly to
	  elas_matinit_cmp_ss.F.

2005-12-15 20:03  willic3

	* [r2529] Added new ielgpetsc variable to hold petsc-specific
	  element number (C-style). This will allow the regular ielg
	  variable to be used normally in other routines.

2005-12-14 22:47  willic3

	* [r2522] Updated routine to be consistent with sieve version of
	  elastc. Arguments passed in as well as arguments passed to
	  iterate have been updated.

2005-12-14 22:46  willic3

	* [r2521] Removed (possibly temporarily) rhs argument to gload_drv.

2005-12-14 22:45  willic3

	* [r2520] Removed unused variables.

2005-12-14 22:44  willic3

	* [r2519] Removed unused variables.

2005-12-14 21:27  willic3

	* [r2518] Fixed arguments and compiler definitions to work with
	  mpif90 based on g95. Note that this is completely non-portable.
	  This file is used as follows: Cat together all fortran files
	  into a single file (test.F). Use the makefile to create test.o.
	  This will catch most errors including argument list mismatches.

2005-12-14 21:23  willic3

	* [r2517] Removed unused format statement.

2005-12-14 21:19  willic3

	* [r2516] Changed all real*8 type definitions to double precision
	  for consistency.

2005-12-14 20:59  willic3

	* [r2515] Added pylithomop3d_processMesh.

2005-12-13 22:19  willic3

	* [r2514] File has now been added to replace residu.f.

2005-12-13 22:18  willic3

	* [r2513] I need to get used to svn. I should have done an 'svn
	  move' originally. This file has been replaced by residu.F.

2005-12-13 22:12  willic3

	* [r2512] Fixed file list, since residu.F has been moved from
	  residu.f (needs preprocessing).

2005-12-13 22:02  willic3

	* [r2511] Initial attempt to merge Matt's Sieve-related changes
	  with the rest of Lithomop. There are probably a few more things
	  to fix.

2005-12-13 19:20  willic3

	* [r2510] Initial svn copy of lithomop trunk to new lithomop-sieve
	  branch.

2005-12-01 16:43  willic3

	* [r2508] Added $(FCLIBS) to list for lithomop3dmodule_la_LIBADD.
	  Without this, I was getting missing g95 symbols on Mac OS X.
	  This will need to be tested on other platforms.

2005-11-21 20:59  willic3

	* [r2503] This file has been moved to 'makefile.test' to avoid
	  conflicts with the new build procedure.

2005-11-16 22:02  willic3

	* [r2499] Changed the version number of LithoMop from 1.0.0 to
	  0.7.1, since I think we're still not ready for a 1.0 release.

2005-10-21 14:02  willic3

	* [r2465] New directory to hold code change summary information.

2005-10-21 14:00  willic3

	* [r2464] Moved all files describing code history to info
	  directory. It might make more sense to rename 'info' to
	  'history'.

2005-10-21 13:59  willic3

	* [r2463] Moved all files describing code history to info
	  directory. It might make more sense to rename 'info' to
	  'history'.

2005-10-11 07:10  willic3

	* [r2410] Moved makefile for compilation tests to makefile.test,
	  so it does not conflict with Makefile produced by the new build
	  procedure.

2005-10-09 03:12  leif

	* [r2405] Ignore files generated by Autoconf/Automake/Libtool.

2005-10-09 01:10  willic3

	* [r2404] All files that require specific fortran features have
	  been modified to use information provided by the new autoconf
	  build procedure.

2005-10-09 01:08  willic3

	* [r2403] Removed lithomop3d/future files from python make
	  targets, since they are not being used.

2005-10-09 01:05  willic3

	* [r2402] Modified configure.ac to perform tests based on fortran
	  capabilities, rather than type/name. Note that it still may be
	  necessary to use AC_RUN_IFELSE rather than AC_COMPILE_IFELSE to
	  truly check some capabilities, although this will then mess up
	  cross-compiling.

2005-09-30 21:07  leif

	* [r2386] Set the language to C++ for MPI tests, which are now
	  sensitive to that sort of thing.

2005-09-30 18:04  leif

	* [r2384] Added files for the GNU Build System.

2005-08-06 03:17  willic3

	* [r1448] Modified *.F files to treat i/o differently for
	  different compilers. Modified Make.mm to replace previous *.f
	  files with *.F files. Modified local.def to add
	  FORTRAN_COMPILER_TYPE (either FORTRAN_TYPE_F77 or
	  FORTRAN_TYPE_F95) and FORTRAN_COMPILER_NAME (presently only need
	  to test for FORTRAN_NAME_GFORTRAN) to PROJ_F77_DEFINES. These
	  must presently be set as environmental variables in the user's
	  environment. There is probably already a config value that
	  defines this information, but I haven't found it yet.

2005-08-23 02:34  unknown_user

	* [r1447] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-08-06 03:04  willic3

	* [r1446] These obsolete files have been moved to 'unused'.

2005-08-06 02:58  willic3

	* [r1445] All of the *.f routines above have been replaced by *.F
	  routines that now need preprocessing. All of the *.F routines
	  have been modified to account for changes in the handling of i/o
	  between f77 and f95. There are 2 main factors that need to be
	  considered: 1. For f95, the access="append" argument is no
	  longer accepted in the open statement. This has been replaced by
	  the position="append" argument. 2. The previous method of doing
	  direct access, unformatted (binary) file writing is no longer
	  available in f95. However, it turns out that g95 supports stream
	  i/o, which provides very similar functionality. The gfortran
	  compiler does not support this, and at present it is assumed
	  that any f95 compiler other than gfortran will support it. Those
	  using gfortran receive a warning message when compiling, and
	  binary UCD output is turned off.

2005-07-09 04:32  willic3

	* [r1444] Added PROJ_DLL stuff, in hopes of making things work for
	  cygwin.

2005-06-30 22:26  willic3

	* [r1443] Quick and dirty routine to add extra nodes on either
	  side of a fault. I'm not sure if this has been tested or not.

2005-06-30 22:24  willic3

	* [r1442] Dummies as placeholders for future mesh output routines.

2005-06-25 03:26  willic3

	* [r1441] Removed obsolete petsc_solver argument from command
	  line. Explicitly specify binary UCD output using the
	  lm3dscan.ucdOutput variable (even though binary is now the
	  default).

2005-06-25 03:22  willic3

	* [r1440] Changed ucdOutput inventory variable from a boolean to a
	  choice with possible values of ("none", "ascii", "binary") with
	  a default value of "binary". Changed usage and definition of the
	  integer equivalent in Lithomop3d_setup.py, and added the integer
	  equivalent to the argument list for write_ucd_mesh_f.

2005-06-25 03:17  willic3

	* [r1439] Updated bindings to pass iucd parameter to
	  write_ucd_mesh_f.

2005-06-25 03:13  willic3

	* [r1438] Added new section for writing binary UCD nodal values
	  and computing nodal min/max values.

2005-06-25 03:12  willic3

	* [r1437] Added entire new section for writing binary UCD mesh
	  info.

2005-06-25 03:11  willic3

	* [r1436] Added new sections to write header info for binary UCD
	  files.

2005-06-25 03:10  willic3

	* [r1435] Updated argument lists to computation routines and added
	  new sections for writing binary UCD file info. Fixed previous
	  bug where UCD files were not being closed after use.

2005-06-25 03:09  willic3

	* [r1434] Added new sections for writing binary UCD files and
	  computing min/max values for state variables.

2005-06-25 03:08  willic3

	* [r1433] Added new option for opening a binary file using direct
	  access.

2005-06-25 03:06  willic3

	* [r1432] Fixed calls to write_ucd_node_vals for updated usage of
	  iucd parameter.

2005-06-20 23:59  willic3

	* [r1431] Initial version of a list of important changes from
	  June, 2004 to June, 2005.

2005-06-18 03:39  willic3

	* [r1430] The numbered logs are raw information using cvs log with
	  a date filter. The changes log is an overview of the changes
	  compiled into a single file. This information needs to be
	  further distilled into a summary log that summarizes important
	  changes over date ranges. These logs are for my own information
	  as well as references when summarizing lithomop progress.

2005-06-09 04:49  willic3

	* [r1429] Fixed ascii output to reflect the fact that displayed
	  rotation angles are in radians rather than degrees.

2005-06-09 04:48  willic3

	* [r1428] Fixed stupid logic error when deciding to perform a
	  local coordinate rotation (used an and when I should have used
	  an or).

2005-06-08 02:39  willic3

	* [r1427] Altered all bindings that use MPI in any way (including
	  those that use PETSc). There is a conflict between names defined
	  by mpi.h and those defined in stdio.h. One way to resolve the
	  conflict is to make sure that mpi.h is always included before
	  stdio.h. All of the C++ codes that initially referenced petsc
	  include files have been altered so that the petsc files are the
	  first ones included. Also, petsc includes have been removed from
	  lithomop3d_externs.h, since this resulted in additional
	  problems. Instead, any files that were getting their petsc
	  definitions from this file now include the petsc definitions
	  individually.

2005-06-08 02:32  willic3

	* [r1426] Removed 'include petsc/default.def' and put this in
	  local.def. In local.def, remove $(MATH_LIBS) from
	  PROJ_LCXX_FLAGS and replaced it with $(EXTERNAL_LIBS). The lack
	  of EXTERNAL_LIBS was what was causing all the Mac build
	  problems, since it turns out that EXTERNAL_LIBS is not used by
	  default when building a library (although EXTERNAL_LIBPATH is).
	  By including this, now all PETSc/MPI stuff is linked when
	  building the library. If this link does not occur, the common
	  blocks defined by PETSc and mpich2 are flagged as 'defined'
	  rather than 'undefined', which will results in a
	  multiply-defined symbol error when creating the module (at least
	  on the Mac).

2005-05-13 22:16  willic3

	* [r1425] Fixed point numbering when writing state variables to
	  UCD file. The number should correspond to the Gauss point number
	  rather than the element number.

2005-05-13 20:45  willic3

	* [r1424] Fixed UCD output so that filenames for different cycles
	  don't conflict with each other. This is done by using the total
	  number of steps as the name basis rather than the number of
	  steps within the curren cycle.

2005-05-12 04:07  willic3

	* [r1423] Moved element type logic out of do loop. Fixed header
	  information to be consistent with nodal output values.

2005-05-06 04:31  willic3

	* [r1422] Problem to test usage of time-varying Winkler elements
	  for locking and unlocking a fault.

2005-05-06 04:17  willic3

	* [r1421] Fixed problem where stiffness matrix was not being
	  zeroed before being reformed. Also, winkler coefficients were
	  not being added to the diagonals, so this was also fixed.

2005-05-06 04:15  willic3

	* [r1420] Fixed problem where stiffness matrix was not being
	  zeroed before being reformed (using MatZeroEntries).

2005-05-06 03:42  willic3

	* [r1419] Replaced incorrect usage of dcur with deld when
	  computing nodal loads equivalent to kinematic BC.

2005-05-06 03:37  willic3

	* [r1418] Removed usage of petscdeveloper.h.

2005-08-23 02:31  unknown_user

	* [r1417] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-05-06 03:36  willic3

	* [r1416] This include file is no longer necessary, as the release
	  of a new PETSc version has made it obsolete. Also, PETSc now
	  includes a tag that duplicates this functionality.

2005-05-06 03:00  willic3

	* [r1415] Simplified logic for determining which version of PETSc
	  is being used. It is now assumed that anyone using a developer
	  version will be using version 2.3 or later, so it is not
	  necessary to use the PETSC_VERSION_RELEASE tag.

2005-05-05 01:44  willic3

	* [r1414] Revised fix for multiple PETSc versions. I have
	  simplified the logic. The supported versions are: 2.2.x
	  (developer or non-developer) 2.3.x (any) Any other version will
	  bomb. I have only tested this with PETSc 2.3.0.

2005-05-04 01:48  willic3

	* [r1413] Updated bindings for usage of Bwink and Bwinkx.

2005-05-04 01:47  willic3

	* [r1412] Added usage of Bwink and Bwinkx, as well as adding
	  corresponding entries to force flags array.

2005-05-04 01:44  willic3

	* [r1411] Created new routine to zero winkler forces when a fault
	  is unlocked. This routine may still be unnecessary, as there is
	  still a problem with Winkler forces.

2005-05-04 01:42  willic3

	* [r1410] Added nwinkflag and nwinkxflag.
	* [r1409] Fixed header output for ascii files.

2005-05-04 01:41  willic3

	* [r1408] Altered winklf to increment bwink (or bwinkx) while
	  updating bintern.

2005-05-04 01:40  willic3

	* [r1407] Added usage of bwink and bwinkx. Changed calls to winklf.

2005-05-04 01:39  willic3

	* [r1406] Added usage of bwink and bwinkx. Altered methods for
	  updating internal force vector in viscos.F. There are still
	  problems with Winkler forces that need to be resolved.

2005-05-04 01:38  willic3

	* [r1405] Added unlock.f to the build list.

2005-05-03 03:45  willic3

	* [r1404] This is an attempt to fix the problems introduced by the
	  presence of a new PETSc version (2.3.0). In the near future, I
	  plan to end support for all previous versions of PETSc, as the
	  nested list of ifs and ifdefs is getting too long to keep track
	  of. This is a tentative fix, and may need to be changed after I
	  have a guinea pig try it out (I don't have version 2.3.0
	  installed yet on my machine).

2005-04-22 06:22  willic3

	* [r1403] Got rid of input_misc.h and replaced it with
	  write_modelinfo.h. Fixed commas that should have been semicolons.

2005-04-22 06:21  willic3

	* [r1402] Moved local, localf, and localx into this section.

2005-04-22 06:20  willic3

	* [r1401] Fixed problem where I had left off the _nodes portion of
	  the routine names for sort_slip and sort_split.

2005-04-22 06:19  willic3

	* [r1400] Fixed problem where I had not finished updating array
	  names for new read_wink routine.

2005-04-22 06:17  willic3

	* [r1399] Added assign_wink and removed local, localf, and localx,
	  which now belong in sparse.

2005-04-22 06:16  willic3

	* [r1398] Added sorting.h to list of includes.

2005-04-22 06:15  willic3

	* [r1397] Fixed problem where time step variables were being
	  initialized in the wrong place. Deleted stray line that didn't
	  belong. Fixed typo for calling write_split.

2005-04-22 06:13  willic3

	* [r1396] Fixed typo in build list.

2005-04-21 08:34  willic3

	* [r1395] Added in missing usage of dprev array.

2005-04-21 08:33  willic3

	* [r1394] Commented out debugging statements.

2005-04-21 08:09  willic3

	* [r1393] Changed all necessary references to point to sorted
	  element node array rather than original array. Removed
	  unnecessary arguments from write_slip and write_split.

2005-04-21 08:07  willic3

	* [r1392] Removed arguments that weren't needed.

2005-04-21 08:05  willic3

	* [r1391] Added new sorting routines.

2005-04-21 08:00  willic3

	* [r1390] Added new output routines.

2005-04-21 07:59  willic3

	* [r1389] Fixed argument types to correspond to updated argument
	  lists.

2005-08-23 02:30  unknown_user

	* [r1388] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-04-21 07:32  willic3

	* [r1387] All of the routines that were previously in these files
	  are now in write_meshinfo.cc and .h, along with the new output
	  routines.

2005-04-21 07:09  willic3

	* [r1386] Altered bindings to reflect usage of sorted element
	  nodes array.

2005-04-21 07:07  willic3

	* [r1385] Removed extra close brace.

2005-04-21 07:04  willic3

	* [r1384] Added new function calls.

2005-04-21 06:46  willic3

	* [r1383] Fixed code so we are now using sorted element node array
	  (Iens rather than Ien). Removed usage of Mhist material history
	  array.

2005-04-21 06:08  willic3

	* [r1382] Added new sets of bindings (sorting and
	  write_modelinfo), and removed input_misc.

2005-04-21 06:06  willic3

	* [r1381] Modified bindings to no longer use Mhist (material
	  history) array.

2005-04-21 06:03  willic3

	* [r1380] Created new bindings for all output routines. This
	  includes routines that existed previously plus new routines.

2005-04-21 03:40  willic3

	* [r1379] Moved in equation localization routines from
	  numbering.cc and modified bindings for new argument lists.

2005-04-21 02:00  willic3

	* [r1378] These routines are no longer needed.

2005-04-21 01:59  willic3

	* [r1377] Removed obsolete routines from build list and added all
	  the new routines.

2005-04-20 07:52  willic3

	* [r1376] Revised bindings for new argument lists. Also, routines
	  that localize equation numbers have been removed. They will be
	  moved to sparse.cc.

2005-04-20 07:29  willic3

	* [r1375] Revised all bindings for new routine calls and removed
	  bindings for read_mathist and read_winkx, which are no longer
	  needed.

2005-08-23 02:30  unknown_user

	* [r1374] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-04-20 07:25  willic3

	* [r1373] Moved this routine to 'unused'. Since formats are the
	  same for regular Winkler and slippery node Winkler forces, the
	  same routine may be used to read them both.

2005-08-23 02:30  unknown_user

	* [r1372] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-04-20 07:11  willic3

	* [r1371] I have removed material histories for now.

	* [r1370] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-04-20 07:10  willic3

	* [r1369] I have eliminated material histories for now. They will
	  become obsolete once we are using a spatial database.

2005-04-16 07:48  willic3

	* [r1368] Cosmetic changes.

2005-04-16 07:47  willic3

	* [r1367] Fixed some improper closing of files.
	* [r1366] Updated output text and fixed some improper closing of
	  files.

2005-04-16 07:46  willic3

	* [r1365] Added some new parameters to be output, corresponding to
	  the way elements are presently handled (no mixing of element
	  types). This may be revised later.

2005-04-16 07:45  willic3

	* [r1364] Changed how Winkler forces are handled. Definitions are
	  now read into temporary arrays, and the actual required arrays
	  (which require global equation numbers) are determined later in
	  subroutine assign_wink.

2005-04-16 07:43  willic3

	* [r1363] Cosmetic changes.

2005-04-16 07:40  willic3

	* [r1362] All of these routines have been modified to no longer
	  use material histories.

2005-04-16 07:39  willic3

	* [r1361] Cosmetic changes.

2005-04-16 07:38  willic3

	* [r1360] All of these routines have been modified to no longer
	  use material histories. Once the spatial database is being used,
	  material histories will become obsolete.

2005-04-16 07:35  willic3

	* [r1359] New routine to take winkler definitions and replace them
	  with values that are needed by the code. It was necessary to
	  break out this functionality from the original read_wink routine
	  so that equation numbers were not required in an input section.

2005-04-16 07:33  willic3

	* [r1358] Cosmetic changes.
	* [r1357] New routine to replace element numbers with reordered
	  numbers.

2005-04-16 07:31  willic3

	* [r1356] Added all of these new output routines. Previously,
	  input and output were performed in the same routine in many
	  cases.

2005-04-16 07:28  willic3

	* [r1355] Added and deleted arguments to several functions to
	  conform to revised interface.

2005-04-15 07:26  willic3

	* [r1354] Deallocated some additional temporary arrays.

2005-04-15 07:18  willic3

	* [r1353] Altered main function to call different functions for
	  the revised setup section. Note that both of these codes need
	  testing, some new f77 routines still need to be written, and the
	  bindings need to be updated.

2005-04-15 07:16  willic3

	* [r1352] Initial revised version of setup section. Things are now
	  divided into several functions: initialize: Get necessary values
	  from scanner read: Read all information and populate
	  corresponding arrays numberequations: Set up global equation
	  numbers based on BC and slippery nodes sortmesh: Sort elements
	  into element families. Additional sorting is done for things
	  that were specified in terms of the original element ordering.
	  sparsesetup: Set up local to global element id arrays and set up
	  sparse matrix structure. allocateremaining:Allocate all
	  additional arrays that are needed for computations. meshwrite:
	  Outputs parameters and mesh description to ascii, plot, and/or
	  UCD files.

2005-04-14 08:01  willic3

	* [r1351] The write_ucd_node_vals routine has been modified to
	  output slippery and split node displacements, and the calls in
	  autoprestr, elastc, and viscos have been modified accordingly.

2005-04-14 07:59  willic3

	* [r1350] All of these routines have been modified so that they
	  only perform input, and all sections in which they perform
	  output, equation reordering, etc., have been removed. These
	  functions will be performed by separate routines.

2005-04-14 07:57  willic3

	* [r1349] Cosmetic changes.

2005-04-14 07:56  willic3

	* [r1348] Removed all output sections from this routine.

2005-04-14 07:55  willic3

	* [r1347] Removed input unit and file information that was no
	  longer necessary.

2005-04-14 07:48  willic3

	* [r1346] Initial version of a simple routine that sorts split
	  node entries according to the new element ordering.

2005-04-14 05:04  willic3

	* [r1345] Added this file as a kludgy fix to let the code know
	  whether the user is using the developer's version of PETSc or
	  not. If so, the tag PETSC_DEVELOPER_VERSION needs to be set to 1.

2005-04-14 05:02  willic3

	* [r1344] Messed around some more with fixing things to work with
	  developer's and non-developer's versions of PETSc. The current
	  fix requires the user to set the value PETSC_DEVELOPER_VERSION
	  to 1 if the developer's version is being used. This is done in
	  petscdeveloper.h. If this ends up being a long-term solution, it
	  will need to be documented. It is hoped that with the new
	  release of PETSc, this fix will be unnecessary. We will simply
	  support only the most current version.

2005-04-13 07:37  willic3

	* [r1343] Left out usage of the infin array for now, as infinite
	  elements are presently broken anyway.

2005-04-13 07:23  willic3

	* [r1342] Initial version of a routine to sort elements into
	  families. The routine is somewhat inefficient with memory, as it
	  requires an additional element node array to hold the sorted
	  results (rather than attempting an in-place sort). The original
	  array may be deleted after use, however. The routine also
	  determines several global dimensions and creates an element
	  family info array as well as an index array containing the
	  original element numbering.

2005-04-13 06:17  willic3

	* [r1341] Stripped out all output, element renumbering, and
	  indexing. This will all be handled by separate routines.

2005-04-13 05:33  willic3

	* [r1340] Stripped out everything but input. Output of BC info (if
	  requested) will be handled by a separate routine.

2005-04-11 01:10  willic3

	* [r1339] Fixed problem where slippery node output always produced
	  nonzero slip weights.

2005-04-09 02:21  willic3

	* [r1336] Updated example files to current version of the code.

2005-04-09 02:10  willic3

	* [r1334] Additional revisions after testing example.

2005-04-09 01:29  willic3

	* [r1332] Updated these input files for current code version.

2005-04-09 01:20  willic3

	* [r1331] Simple test problem using slippery nodes.

2005-04-09 00:38  willic3

	* [r1330] Moved the definition of pointerToIpslp out of an if
	  block. This array is passed to several driver routines even when
	  it is not used. Having it defined inside the if block cause an
	  error message at the end of code execution.

2005-04-08 07:47  willic3

	* [r1329] Added '-ksp_rtol 1e-9' to the command line arguments.
	  This dramatically improves the accuracy for slippery node tests,
	  and likely will help for the other test problems. I need to
	  change all of the Make.mm files for example problems to be
	  similar to these, and also need to modify all input files for
	  current formats.

2005-04-08 07:41  willic3

	* [r1328] Cosmetic changes.

2005-04-08 07:40  willic3

	* [r1327] Changed routine so all indexing is done with local
	  arrays that are altered to work with PETSc. Fixed problem where
	  absolute value of lmx array (suitably altered) was needed for
	  MatSetValues rather than the actual array. Fixed problem where
	  row and column index arrays appeared to be swapped in
	  MatSetValues in cases involving slippery nodes.

2005-04-08 07:37  willic3

	* [r1326] Fixed stupid bug where I was not indexing the ien array
	  when sending it to addsn.

2005-04-08 07:33  willic3

	* [r1325] Retained commented-out debugging statements.
	* [r1324] Retained commented-out debugging statement that uses
	  PETSc MatView routine.

2005-04-08 07:31  willic3

	* [r1323] Cosmetic changes and retained commented-out debugging
	  statements.

2005-04-08 07:30  willic3

	* [r1322] Changed definition of alpha parameter from a parameter
	  statement to a data statement since it is being passed as an
	  argument.

2005-04-06 06:14  willic3

	* [r1321] Added input files to run SCEC BM5. This serves as a test
	  of split nodes.

2005-04-06 06:07  willic3

	* [r1320] Modified calls to read_connect, read_split, and
	  read_slip to create and use element indexing array. It is then
	  destroyed after use.

2005-04-06 06:04  willic3

	* [r1319] Fixed major bug where I wasn't indexing state variable
	  and other arrays before passing them to computational routines.

2005-04-06 06:03  willic3

	* [r1318] Cosmetic changes.

2005-04-06 06:02  willic3

	* [r1317] Removed usage of ielg element counter, which isn't
	  needed.

2005-04-06 06:01  willic3

	* [r1316] Cosmetic changes.

2005-04-06 06:00  willic3

	* [r1315] Fixed improper indexing of itmp array.
	* [r1314] Cosmetic changes.

2005-04-06 05:56  willic3

	* [r1313] Updated call to addstf to pass stemp array.

2005-04-06 05:54  willic3

	* [r1312] Updated call to addstf to pass stemp array.

2005-04-06 05:52  willic3

	* [r1311] Modified this routine for cases where there are slippery
	  nodes: Added new index array that is the absolute value of the
	  slippery node index array. According to the MatSetValues
	  documentation, negative indices are skipped, which would mean
	  entries from the negative side of the fault would never get
	  added. This should fix that problem. Changed setup of routine so
	  that portion related to slippery nodes is never executed if
	  element contains no slippery nodes. Changed routine for
	  efficiency. Rather than switching stiffness matrix signs back
	  and forth, I use two arrays, and never change the entries of the
	  local stiffness array. Instead, the properly-signed values are
	  transferred into the stemp array, and this is used instead. To
	  do this, I now pass in the stemp array from all calling
	  routines. This routine needs to be tested.

2005-04-06 05:39  willic3

	* [r1310] Modified these routines to account for the fact that
	  split and slippery nodes are specified using the original
	  element ordering rather than the revised ordering that occurs
	  after they are sorted into families. Routine read_connect
	  creates the index array to do this, and both read_slip and
	  read_split have been modified to use it. After use, the index
	  array may be destroyed.

2005-04-06 05:36  willic3

	* [r1309] Updated bindings for read_connect, read_split, and
	  read_slip to use element index array. This accounts for the fact
	  that split and slippery nodes are specified using the original
	  element numbering rather than the numbering that occurs after
	  elements are sorted into families.

2005-04-05 22:47  willic3

	* [r1308] Fixed conditional compilation to key on
	  PETSC_VERSION_PATCH. Only version 2.2.1 is supported, and it is
	  assumed that all versions less than version patch 42 do not
	  include MatSetSizes. This needs to be tested with different
	  patch versions.

2005-04-03 11:56  willic3

	* [r1307] Added conditional compilation depending on whether
	  MatSetSizes is defined.

2005-04-03 06:11  willic3

	* [r1306] Cosmetic change.

2005-04-02 07:59  willic3

	* [r1305] Updated these to account for new and deleted parameters,
	  and new method of specifying state variable output.

2005-04-02 07:58  willic3

	* [r1304] Added commented-out line for PETSc debugging when
	  desired. This is presently not working.

2005-04-02 07:56  willic3

	* [r1303] Fixed bindings for createPETScMat to account for new
	  PETSc calling conventions. Matrix size is now set separately
	  using MatSetSizes.

2005-04-02 07:54  willic3

	* [r1302] Fixed bindings for scan_connect.
	* [r1301] Updated bindings to use Dprev vector. Also fixed
	  definitions in lithomop3d_externs.h to account for changed call
	  to scan_connect.

2005-04-02 07:50  willic3

	* [r1300] Added ElementTypeDef.py to EXPORT_PYTHON_MODULES.

2005-04-02 07:49  willic3

	* [r1299] Added autoprestrStage. Put back in the Dprev vector.
	  Added back in connectivitySize which is now a function of
	  numberElementNodes and numberVolumeElements. Put in definition
	  of reformFlagInt. Fixed usage of ElementTypeDef class. Fixed
	  output of subiteration parameters. Fixed some typos. Removed
	  unused lists.

2005-04-02 07:45  willic3

	* [r1298] Added or re-added some parameters that were needed.
	  Increased dimension of VolumeElementFamilyList to allow tracking
	  of material model, and then made the corresponding changes in
	  the call to scan_connect.

2005-04-02 07:42  willic3

	* [r1297] Added autoprestrStage to PETSc stages, and added usage
	  of Dprev vector when a nonzero initial guess is desired.

2005-04-02 07:40  willic3

	* [r1296] Modified all parameter names to explicitly include
	  'Volume' name, to indicate element type.

2005-04-02 07:37  willic3

	* [r1295] Put this routine back in, since it is needed to compute
	  element stiffness matrix.

2005-04-02 07:36  willic3

	* [r1294] Commented out debugging statements.

2005-04-02 07:35  willic3

	* [r1293] Build list was modified to include getmat.f, which is
	  needed to compute the local stiffness matrix.

2005-04-02 07:34  willic3

	* [r1292] All of these routines were modified to pass along the
	  iddmat index array, which is needed by routine stiff_ss.

2005-04-02 07:31  willic3

	* [r1291] Fixed incredibly stupid problem where I had substituted
	  a BLAS matrix-vector operation for a matrix-matrix operation.
	  Since it appears that BLAS does not have a routine to multiply a
	  packed symmetric matrix by another matrix, it was also necessary
	  to use the iddmat index array, which I had previously deleted.
	  This also made it necessary to use the getmat routine, which
	  transfers the packed array to a full-size array. Note that these
	  problems can all be avoided once I get rid of the global dmat
	  array. Once this is no longer stored globally there will be no
	  need to use a packed array.

2005-04-02 07:26  willic3

	* [r1290] Commented out debugging statements.

2005-04-02 07:25  willic3

	* [r1289] Commented out debugging statements.

2005-04-02 07:24  willic3

	* [r1288] Fixed problem where ivfamily entry corresponded to
	  material type rather than material model. Fixed this by adding
	  an extra column to ivflist array created in scan_connect to
	  track material model. Routine read_connect was then modified to
	  use this information.

2005-04-02 07:18  willic3

	* [r1287] Fixed routines so iddmat index matrix is now being
	  passed to formes_ss. Fixed problem in td_matinit_cmp_ss where
	  global element number was not being updated.

2005-04-02 07:16  willic3

	* [r1286] Cosmetic changes.

2005-04-02 07:14  willic3

	* [r1285] Fixed stupid problem in update_state_drv where I was
	  attempting to loop over nelfamily rather than nvfamilies. Fixed
	  stupid problem in update_state_cmp where I was not indexing the
	  state variable arrays.

2005-04-02 07:12  willic3

	* [r1284] Commented out debugging statements. Fixed tracking of
	  global element number.

2005-04-02 07:10  willic3

	* [r1283] Updated all dummy material routines to match the layout
	  of mat_1.

2005-04-02 07:07  willic3

	* [r1282] Numerous changes and additions to these routines, which
	  had not been modified previously to use new indexing methods.
	  Fixed engineering strain problem. Fixed argument lists and
	  indexing for new methods. Stress computation routines are now
	  responsible for populating scur Gauss-point-level array.
	  Completely revised time-dependent stress computation and fixed
	  stupid indexing error. Added get_state and update_state routines.

2005-04-02 07:01  willic3

	* [r1281] Several fixes to these routines after debugging: Fixed
	  error codes not being sent to write_state_drv. Fixed problem
	  where iddmat was not being sent to routines that compute the
	  element stiffness matrix. Attempted to solve problem when
	  nonzero initial guess is used for linear solution, by
	  reimplementing usage of the dprev vector. Note that this still
	  does not seem to work correctly, at least for SCEC BM1.

2005-04-02 06:55  willic3

	* [r1280] Very low resolution version of SCEC BM1 that is good for
	  debugging.

2005-04-01 07:28  willic3

	* [r1279] Deleted first line from license text.

2005-04-01 07:27  willic3

	* [r1278] Updated all bindings for new calls and argument lists.
	  The PETSc calls in sparse.cc are still incorrect and need to be
	  fixed.

2005-03-31 03:46  willic3

	* [r1277] Removed unused variables.

2005-03-31 03:43  willic3

	* [r1276] This routine presently only outputs the flag determining
	  the initial guess for the linear solution. All other additional
	  information that was output previously is now handled by PETSc.

2005-03-31 03:34  willic3

	* [r1275] Fixed line that was too long.

2005-03-31 03:26  willic3

	* [r1274] These obsolete include files have been moved to 'unused'.

2005-03-30 12:51  willic3

	* [r1273] These obsolete routines have been moved to 'unused'.

2005-08-23 02:25  unknown_user

	* [r1272] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-03-30 12:50  willic3

	* [r1271] These routines have been moved to 'unused' as they have
	  been replaced by PETSc routines.

2005-03-30 12:49  willic3

	* [r1270] Added new routines to build list and removed those that
	  are no longer needed.

2005-03-30 09:56  willic3

	* [r1269] Extensive modifications of all python drivers to make
	  things consistent with new layout of f77 code using element
	  families, etc. Also, an attempt has been made to make a cleaner
	  separation between the functions of the different codes.
	  Lithomop3d_scan.py now is devoted almost exclusively to getting
	  the dimensions of the problem, with a few auxiliary tasks.
	  Lithomop3d_setup.py does most of the work, including allocating
	  memory, populating arrays, and setting up the sparse matrix
	  system. Lithomop3d_run.py now simply uses the structures created
	  by Lithomop3d_setup.py and then calls the f77 driver routines.

2005-03-30 09:51  willic3

	* [r1268] Removed many unnecessary parameters and include
	  statements.

2005-03-30 05:43  willic3

	* [r1267] Removed usage of obsolete include files.

2005-08-23 02:24  unknown_user

	* [r1266] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-03-30 03:17  willic3

	* [r1265] These have all been moved to 'unused'. The r-dimension
	  statements are no longer needed for the linear solver, and the
	  w-dimension statements were only needed in routines read_wink
	  and read_winkx (and weren't being used).

2005-08-23 02:24  unknown_user

	* [r1264] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-03-30 02:55  willic3

	* [r1263] Removed these dimension and definition files. They refer
	  to linear solution parameters that are now handled by PETSc.

2005-08-23 02:24  unknown_user

	* [r1262] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-03-30 02:26  willic3

	* [r1261] Removed these dimension include files, which are only
	  needed locally in routine iterate and routines called by it.

2005-03-29 09:32  willic3

	* [r1260] Removed bwork array, which is no longer needed.

2005-03-29 09:30  willic3

	* [r1259] Removed bwork array, which is no longer needed.

2005-03-29 09:28  willic3

	* [r1258] Removed bwork array, which is no longer needed.

2005-03-29 07:52  willic3

	* [r1257] Removed usage of ismatmod array. This is no longer
	  needed because all state-variable-related functions are now
	  performed by a material-model-level routine.

2005-03-29 03:53  willic3

	* [r1256] Completely updated routine to use element families
	  (presently defined by their material type). The routine now
	  returns: ivfamily: Integer array defining family properties.
	  ien: Global element nodes array. nstatesz: Size of global state
	  variable array. nstatesz0: Size of global initial state variable
	  array. npropsz: Size of global material properties array.

2005-03-29 03:50  willic3

	* [r1255] Updated routine to count the number of element families,
	  and added a second entry to ivflist that tells what material
	  type is associated with the family.

2005-03-26 09:05  willic3

	* [r1254] Initial revised version of connectivity scanning
	  routine. The routine presently returns the number of volume
	  elements, the global volume element type, and the number of
	  volume element families. The routine also returns a list that
	  contains the number of elements in each family.

2005-03-26 08:50  willic3

	* [r1253] Updated this routine to use element families rather than
	  material types. This routine will become obsolete once I start
	  using a spatial database. In that case, a different database
	  will be specified for each time at which a change is desired,
	  and a global time history will determine when to recheck the
	  database.

2005-03-26 08:41  willic3

	* [r1252] Updated this routine for using element families, leading
	  to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so that an
	  element family simply consists of a single material type, and it
	  is no longer possible to mix elements. This means that there are
	  no longer any arrays with final dimension netypes, and strides
	  through all elements in a family are constant. It will probably
	  not be too hard to add back in the option of mixing element
	  types, but it is not a priority at present.

2005-03-26 07:34  willic3

	* [r1251] Updated this routine for using element families, leading
	  to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so that an
	  element family simply consists of a single material type, and it
	  is no longer possible to mix elements. This means that there are
	  no longer any arrays with final dimension netypes, and strides
	  through all elements in a family are constant. It will probably
	  not be too hard to add back in the option of mixing element
	  types, but it is not a priority at present. Removed dprev array,
	  which is no longer needed. The displacement increments are now
	  copied directly from deld into dispvec at the end of a time step.

2005-03-26 07:32  willic3

	* [r1250] Updated this routine for using element families, leading
	  to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so that an
	  element family simply consists of a single material type, and it
	  is no longer possible to mix elements. This means that there are
	  no longer any arrays with final dimension netypes, and strides
	  through all elements in a family are constant. It will probably
	  not be too hard to add back in the option of mixing element
	  types, but it is not a priority at present. Removed dprev array,
	  which is no longer needed. The displacement increments are now
	  copied directly from deld into dispvec at the end of a time
	  step. Added call at the end of the solution to accomplish this
	  by calling idisp.

2005-03-26 07:31  willic3

	* [r1249] Removed dprev array, which is no longer needed. The
	  displacement increments are now copied directly from deld into
	  dispvec at the end of a time step. Added call at the end of the
	  solution to accomplish this by calling idisp.

2005-03-26 07:29  willic3

	* [r1248] Removed dprev array, which is no longer needed. The
	  displacement increments are now copied directly from deld into
	  dispvec at the end of a time step.

2005-03-26 07:27  willic3

	* [r1247] Updated this routine for using element families, leading
	  to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so that an
	  element family simply consists of a single material type, and it
	  is no longer possible to mix elements. This means that there are
	  no longer any arrays with final dimension netypes, and strides
	  through all elements in a family are constant. It will probably
	  not be too hard to add back in the option of mixing element
	  types, but it is not a priority at present.

2005-03-26 07:07  willic3

	* [r1246] This obsolete routine has been moved to 'unused'.

2005-08-23 02:24  unknown_user

	* [r1245] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-03-26 07:06  willic3

	* [r1244] This obsolete routine has been replaced by
	  update_state_drv and update_state_cmp, which rely on
	  material-model-specific routines to update the state variables.
	  This approach is more flexible, allowing arbitrary sets of state
	  variables.

2005-03-26 07:04  willic3

	* [r1243] Revised linked list code to only allow one element type
	  at a time. This simplifies bookkeeping, but is less flexible.

2005-03-26 06:52  willic3

	* [r1242] The output routines have been replaced with new
	  versions. The lnklst routine is being replaced by a version that
	  only allows one element type at a time (similar to the original
	  version).

2005-08-23 02:24  unknown_user

	* [r1241] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-03-26 06:50  willic3

	* [r1240] These obsolete routines have been moved to 'unused'.
	  They are superceded by the new routines write_state_drv.f and
	  write_state_cmp.f.

2005-03-26 06:32  willic3

	* [r1239] Created a routine to transfer displacement array into
	  displacement vector. This is to provide an initial guess for the
	  displacement vector when requested.

2005-03-26 05:57  willic3

	* [r1238] Updated this routine for using element families, leading
	  to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so that an
	  element family simply consists of a single material type, and it
	  is no longer possible to mix elements. This means that there are
	  no longer any arrays with final dimension netypes, and strides
	  through all elements in a family are constant. It will probably
	  not be too hard to add back in the option of mixing element
	  types, but it is not a priority at present.

2005-03-26 04:34  willic3

	* [r1237] Updated this routine for using element families, leading
	  to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so that an
	  element family simply consists of a single material type, and it
	  is no longer possible to mix elements. This means that there are
	  no longer any arrays with final dimension netypes, and strides
	  through all elements in a family are constant. It will probably
	  not be too hard to add back in the option of mixing element
	  types, but it is not a priority at present.

2005-03-25 09:36  willic3

	* [r1236] Eliminated parameters that are no longer needed
	  (ndmatsz, nconsz, and nstates0) and added nvfamilies. Also
	  changed numelt to numelv.

2005-03-25 09:30  willic3

	* [r1235] Set maximum number of state variables to 24, rather than
	  4. The previous method assumed that state variables always
	  occurred in sets of 6.

2005-03-25 09:19  willic3

	* [r1234] Removed debugging comments.

2005-03-25 07:38  willic3

	* [r1233] Removed debugging comments. In the near future, this
	  routine will no longer need the lm and lmx arrays, and will not
	  have to do the slippery node bookkeeping.

2005-03-24 10:08  willic3

	* [r1232] Fixed bug in formation of material matrix. I had
	  forgotten that I was using engineering strain. I need to
	  determine whethe it is better this way or if I should switch
	  over to tensor strain. If not, I will also need to make these
	  same changes to mat_5.f. Also added new get_state_1 routine to
	  transfer state variables into a local array.

2005-03-24 07:30  willic3

	* [r1231] Initial version of driver routine to write selected
	  state variables to output files (ascii, plot, UCD).

2005-03-24 03:58  willic3

	* [r1230] Simple routine to name and open a UCD output file.

2005-03-24 02:39  willic3

	* [r1229] Include file containing external routine names for
	  routines that populate a given array with state variables.

2005-03-24 02:30  willic3

	* [r1228] Simple routine to write the UCD header for state
	  variable output.

2005-03-24 02:23  willic3

	* [r1227] Initial version of routine to write selected state
	  variables to output files (ascii, plot, UCD).

2005-03-24 01:16  willic3

	* [r1226] Labels have been extended and modified to indicate
	  whether they represent total, incremental, or rate values.

2005-03-24 01:14  willic3

	* [r1225] Additional change to make use of new label definitions.

2005-03-24 00:55  willic3

	* [r1224] Revised method of specifying which state variables to
	  output. User now specifies 3 lines of state variables
	  corresponding to total, incremental, and rate values. There is
	  also now a new array (nstatout) that stores the number of each
	  type to output.

2005-03-23 10:51  willic3

	* [r1223] Added update_state_1 routine to update state variables,
	  and fixed call to dcopy in td_strs_1 so dstate (current stress
	  estimate) is copied into scur rather than state (estimate for
	  previous time step).

2005-03-23 10:47  willic3

	* [r1222] Incomplete version of driver routine to output state
	  variables, looping over element families. This routine will
	  replace both write_state and write_ucd_gauss_vals. I still need
	  to determine if there is a need to output values at element
	  centroids purely for visualization.

2005-03-23 10:44  willic3

	* [r1221] Incomplete version of routine to write selected state
	  variables to output files (ascii, binary, UCD). The routine
	  relies on a material-model-specific routine to populate a
	  working array with state variables.

2005-03-23 09:51  willic3

	* [r1220] I had not sent the proper array info to the computation
	  routine. I needed to fix things in this routine so the arrays
	  corresponding to the first element in a family were used.

2005-03-23 07:52  willic3

	* [r1219] Updated routine to read output options for each state
	  variable individually. Also, ascii output now gives state
	  variable name rather than an integer.

2005-03-23 07:27  willic3

	* [r1218] Added include file with external names for routines that
	  update state variables.

2005-03-23 07:25  willic3

	* [r1217] Updated dimensions of labels character array.

2005-03-23 07:24  willic3

	* [r1216] Updated state variable labels to reflect new output
	  options.

2005-03-23 06:23  willic3

	* [r1215] This new routine is called by the update_state driver
	  routine, and its only purpose is to receive the proper function
	  pointer for the element family and then loop over the elements
	  in that family (and the gauss points within each element),
	  calling the proper function to update the state variables.
	* [r1214] This new routine is the driver routine to update state
	  variables at the end of a time step, and replaces the previous
	  update_state routine. This routine loops over element families
	  and calls a computation routine that in turn relies on an
	  updating routine that is specific for each material model.

2005-03-23 03:59  willic3

	* [r1213] Temporarily fixed this so that material types correspond
	  to element families. This will need to be modified in the future.

2005-03-23 03:51  willic3

	* [r1212] Updated routine to give number of volume elements. This
	  will need to be updated to include other element types as they
	  are implemented.

2005-03-23 03:46  willic3

	* [r1211] Updated this routine for using element families, leading
	  to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so that an
	  element family simply consists of a single material type, and it
	  is no longer possible to mix elements. This means that there are
	  no longer any arrays with final dimension netypes, and strides
	  through all elements in a family are constant. It will probably
	  not be too hard to add back in the option of mixing element
	  types, but it is not a priority at present.

2005-03-23 03:18  willic3

	* [r1210] Updated this routine for using element families, leading
	  to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so that an
	  element family simply consists of a single material type, and it
	  is no longer possible to mix elements. This means that there are
	  no longer any arrays with final dimension netypes, and strides
	  through all elements in a family are constant. It will probably
	  not be too hard to add back in the option of mixing element
	  types, but it is not a priority at present.

2005-03-22 12:45  willic3

	* [r1209] Updated all of these routines to be consistent with
	  their calls from routine preshape. Changes include: All element
	  dimension info is passed in rather than being computed.
	  Dimensions are changed to match each element rather than having
	  max possible dimensions. Only array sh is computed. The shj
	  array is computed in preshape.

2005-03-22 10:26  willic3

	* [r1208] New python class to define characteristics for a given
	  element type and integration order. The ElementTypeDef class
	  provides: numberElementNodes numberElementGaussPoints
	  numberElementEquations numberElementCoordinates Shape function
	  array (includes derivatives) Shape function array used for
	  Jacobians Gauss point array (coordinates and weights)

2005-03-22 10:22  willic3

	* [r1207] Revised version of preshape routine that now returns a
	  set of gauss points and shape functions for a given element type
	  rather than computing these for all possible element types.
	  Infinite element options have been commented out for now, since
	  they are broken, and the current setup also doesn't allow use of
	  more than one element type at a time. This will need to be
	  revised in the near future.

2005-03-22 07:19  willic3

	* [r1206] Updated routine to reflect revised method of tracking
	  state variables.

2005-03-22 07:05  willic3

	* [r1205] Updated this routine for using element families, leading
	  to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so that an
	  element family simply consists of a single material type, and it
	  is no longer possible to mix elements. This means that there are
	  no longer any arrays with final dimension netypes, and strides
	  through all elements in a family are constant. It will probably
	  not be too hard to add back in the option of mixing element
	  types, but it is not a priority at present.

2005-03-22 06:35  willic3

	* [r1204] Modified equation localization routines to account for
	  only one element type being used at a time. Note that all of the
	  element arrays that provide equation numbers will become
	  obsolete once the new methods of doing kinematic BC are
	  implemented. This means that these routines will no longer be
	  needed.

2005-03-22 06:13  willic3

	* [r1203] Updated body force routines for using element families,
	  leading to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so
	  that an element family simply consists of a single material
	  type, and it is no longer possible to mix elements. This means
	  that there are no longer any arrays with final dimension
	  netypes, and strides through all elements in a family are
	  constant. It will probably not be too hard to add back in the
	  option of mixing element types, but it is not a priority at
	  present.

2005-03-22 06:11  willic3

	* [r1202] Updated calls to stress computation routines so argument
	  lists match. Index for element-level arrays now uses global
	  element number, and called routines are now responsible for
	  updating this number.

2005-03-22 04:11  willic3

	* [r1201] Fixed dimension of ivfamily.

2005-03-22 03:48  willic3

	* [r1200] Updated this routine for using element families, leading
	  to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so that an
	  element family simply consists of a single material type, and it
	  is no longer possible to mix elements. This means that there are
	  no longer any arrays with final dimension netypes, and strides
	  through all elements in a family are constant. It will probably
	  not be too hard to add back in the option of mixing element
	  types, but it is not a priority at present. Note that this
	  routine is still not sufficiently general, as it assumes that
	  the initial state variables are always stresses.

2005-03-22 03:31  willic3

	* [r1199] Updated this routine for using element families, leading
	  to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so that an
	  element family simply consists of a single material type, and it
	  is no longer possible to mix elements. This means that there are
	  no longer any arrays with final dimension netypes, and strides
	  through all elements in a family are constant. It will probably
	  not be too hard to add back in the option of mixing element
	  types, but it is not a priority at present. Note that this
	  routine will become obsolete once the new method of dealing with
	  kinematic BC is implemented.

2005-03-22 03:30  willic3

	* [r1198] Removed definition of matmodel, which isn't needed in
	  this routine.

2005-03-22 03:12  willic3

	* [r1197] Updated this routine for using element families, leading
	  to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so that an
	  element family simply consists of a single material type, and it
	  is no longer possible to mix elements. This means that there are
	  no longer any arrays with final dimension netypes, and strides
	  through all elements in a family are constant. It will probably
	  not be too hard to add back in the option of mixing element
	  types, but it is not a priority at present. Note that this
	  routine will become obsolete once the new method of dealing with
	  kinematic BC is implemented.

2005-03-19 09:57  willic3

	* [r1196] Incomplete modified versions of scanning and setup
	  routines for lithomop, as an initial attempt at modifying how
	  indexing is done, as well as trying to do a better job of
	  separating different tasks. These codes need much more
	  modification, and need to be consistent with f77 routines and
	  with each other.

2005-03-19 09:53  willic3

	* [r1195] Incomplete new version of routine to scan element node
	  list. This needs to be made consistent with the python calls,
	  and I should probably only define dimensions in this routine, as
	  opposed to populating any arrays.

2005-03-19 09:49  willic3

	* [r1194] Updated all these routines for using element families,
	  leading to reduced indexing. At present, everything is set up so
	  that an element family simply consists of a single material
	  type, and it is no longer possible to mix elements. This means
	  that there are no longer any arrays with final dimension
	  netypes, and strides through all elements in a family are
	  constant. It will probably not be too hard to add back in the
	  option of mixing element types, but it is not a priority at
	  present.

2005-03-19 09:43  willic3

	* [r1193] Added PETSc and MPI include paths for makefile used to
	  check routine internal consistency.

2005-03-19 06:59  willic3

	* [r1192] This obsolete routine has been moved to the 'unused'
	  directory.

2005-08-23 02:23  unknown_user

	* [r1191] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-03-19 06:58  willic3

	* [r1190] Removed this routine, which was used to create a full
	  array from a compacted version of a symmetric array. For
	  multiplications using this type of array, the BLAS routine dspmv
	  may be used.

2005-03-18 02:39  willic3

	* [r1189] Set p = NULL in the deconstructor, as advised by Brad.
	  This is just an additional precaution to make sure the pointer
	  doesn't point to anything once it is deallocated.

2005-03-18 02:38  willic3

	* [r1188] This version now has some commented out debugging
	  statements.

2005-03-12 10:05  willic3

	* [r1187] This routine has been altered to separate input from
	  equation numbering. This means that the call to read_bc has been
	  altered, the call to adjid has been removed, and all numbering
	  is now done in new routine create_id. Also, the call to
	  read_wink has been moved below that to create_id, since the
	  equation numbers are needed here.

2005-03-12 10:03  willic3

	* [r1186] Bindings have been updated to reflect the removal of
	  adjid, the addition of create_id, and the alteration of read_bc.
	  Also, all index-related routines have been broken out into a new
	  set of bindings (numbering.cc and numbering.h) and removed from
	  input_misc.

2005-03-12 09:59  willic3

	* [r1185] All portions of read_bc related to creating global
	  equation numbers have been removed and moved into create_id.f.
	  The create_id routine also adds the extra equations created by
	  slippery nodes.

2005-03-12 09:57  willic3

	* [r1184] Removed adjid.f from the build list and added
	  create_id.f.

2005-08-23 02:23  unknown_user

	* [r1183] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-03-12 09:57  willic3

	* [r1182] This routine has been removed and its functionality is
	  now included in create_id.

2005-03-12 07:55  willic3

	* [r1181] Added deallocation function to TODO list.

2005-03-12 05:59  willic3

	* [r1180] Updated TODO list, primarily high-priority items to aid
	  use of PETSc.

2005-08-23 02:23  unknown_user

	* [r1179] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-03-11 12:07  knepley

	* [r1178] Removed alnz and ja everywhere Added the .F files I
	  forgot to add before

2005-08-23 02:22  unknown_user

	* [r1177] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-03-11 11:20  knepley

	* [r1176] Now put values directly in the PETSc matrix

2005-03-11 10:51  willic3

	* [r1175] Added -typos=relaxed so command-line arguments do not
	  need to be in inventory.

2005-03-11 10:40  willic3

	* [r1174] Added a new F77EXTERNS option that fixed a Mac-specific
	  problem with f77 name mangling. This was done because of
	  incompatibilities with PETSC/MPICH, and to make things work
	  correctly, the following files were also changed:
	  config/compiler/gcc-3.x-Darwin/config_f77.h: added
	  F77EXTERNS_SOMETIMES_EXTRATRAILINGBAR
	  config/compiler/gcc-3.x-Darwin/f77.def: removed
	  -fno-second-underscore from COMPILER_F77_FLAGS

2005-03-11 10:30  willic3

	* [r1173] Changes app.main() to app.run().

2005-03-11 10:17  willic3

	* [r1172] Added call to lm3dscan.preinitialize.

2005-03-11 10:16  willic3

	* [r1171] Updated inventory for pythia-0.8 and also changed name
	  of _init function to preinitialize, which conflicted with new
	  pyre.

2005-03-11 10:15  willic3

	* [r1170] Updated for pythia-0.8, and commented out petsc-specific
	  inventory.

2005-03-10 09:10  knepley

	* [r1169] Now allocate PETSc matrix separately Allocate PETSc
	  storage when ja() is made - Use an option to flag new nonzeros

2005-03-10 01:46  knepley

	* [r1168] Made PETSc tag

2005-03-09 08:43  willic3

	* [r1167] Revised (but incomplete and somewhat out-of-date) UML
	  diagram describing an element family.

2005-03-08 11:04  knepley

	* [r1166] Added PETSc preallocation

2005-08-23 02:20  unknown_user

	* [r1165] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-03-08 10:14  knepley

	* [r1164] Moved some files to .F for preprocessing Added some
	  PETSc options to lithomop3d application Added PETSc
	  initialize/finalize Added PETSc logging to the setup and run
	  phases

2005-03-01 04:48  willic3

	* [r1163] Tentative template for a f77 include file that defines
	  the global dimensions for element family interpolation. Note
	  that I am not yet convinced that this method of defining a
	  separate interpolation family for each possible interpolation
	  order is really the way to go.

2005-03-01 04:46  willic3

	* [r1162] Tentative template for a f77 include file that defines
	  the array values for element family interpolation. Note that I
	  am not yet convinced that this method of defining a separate
	  interpolation family for each possible interpolation order is
	  really the way to go.

2005-03-01 03:44  willic3

	* [r1161] New top-level TODO list.

2005-02-24 08:56  willic3

	* [r1159] Files needed to run a number of tests for implementation
	  of initial stresses.

	* [r1157] Files to run a number of tests for initial stress
	  implementation.

2005-02-24 08:41  willic3

	* [r1155] Updated all bindings to reflect revised argument lists
	  for both python calls and f77 subroutine definitions.

2005-02-24 08:38  willic3

	* [r1153] Numerous changes related to the elimination of the
	  bprestress array and the usage of the state0 array. Several
	  parameter and argument lists have been altered, new arrays have
	  been created, and the autoprestr function is now fully
	  implemented.

2005-02-24 08:32  willic3

	* [r1151] Updated parameter list to include tpois and tyoungs, and
	  eliminated usage of autofac scaling factor for autoprestress

	  computation of initial stresses.

2005-02-24 08:23  willic3

	* [r1141] Added usage of state0 and associated variables, and

2005-02-24 08:14  willic3

	* [r1125] Numerous changes to use and compute initial stresses to
	  be stored in state0 array. Updating of elastic and
	  time-dependent stresses has been changed to reflect initial
	  stresses, and the prestress computation routine has been altered
	  to make use of user-specified initial values for Poisson's ratio
	  and Young's modulus, if desired. A new formulation, based on an
	  effective stress function formulation, has been employed for
	  stress computation and tangent stress-strain matrix computation.
	  The stress computation takes initial stresses into account.

2005-02-24 08:07  willic3

	* [r1123] Numerous changes to use and compute initial stresses to
	  be stored in state0 array. Updating of elastic and
	  time-dependent stresses has been changed to reflect initial
	  stresses, and the prestress computation routine has been altered
	  to make use of user-specified initial values for Poisson's ratio
	  and Young's modulus, if desired.

	* [r1103] Increased leading dimension of infiel array to 7, to
	  account for new indexing of state0 array.

	  information is now carried in the state0 array.
	* [r1099] Numerous changes involving elimination of bprestress
	  array and use of state0 array to hold initial stresses. Fixed

	  from the state array into the initial stress array after
	  automatic precomputation.

2005-02-03 04:26  willic3

	* [r1093] Rough idea of what is needed to describe a volume
	  element interpolation family. This needs to be tidied up, and
	  the equivalent information for other interpolation families
	  needs to be defined.

2005-02-02 07:38  willic3

	* [r1092] Put in conditions to create tractionFlag.

	  debugging feature.

2005-01-20 04:28  willic3

	* [r1085] Altered routine to output a special file name for
	  prestress computation. This may later be eliminated as a

2005-01-20 04:08  willic3

	* [r1084] Modified Make.mm to work with new std-fortran.def file
	  and unmodified std-builds.def file. Creating the shared object
	  (f77 objects plus BLAS) is much simpler, as almost everything is
	  now added via PROJ_LCXX_FLAGS.

2005-01-20 04:06  willic3

	* [r1082] Updated local.def for new std-fortran.def. Modified
	  std-builds.def is no longer needed. This version works, but is
	  not necessarily correct. The main question at present is where
	  MATH_LIBS should be added. At present, they are appended to
	  PROJ_LCXX_FLAGS (along with LCXX_FORTRAN).

2005-01-19 06:26  willic3

	* [r1080] Added autoprestr to build list.

2005-01-19 04:43  willic3

	* [r1061] Added new routine to compute material matrix for
	  prestress computation.

2005-01-19 01:55  willic3

	* [r1060] Added usage of iprestress variable, which is set to 1
	  when computing prestresses. Simplified criterion for updating
	  stress/body force BC. Removed commented-out code that is no
	  longer needed.

2005-01-19 01:51  willic3

	* [r1059] Reverted to calls to elas_strs_mat_cmp_xx, since a
	  separate computation routine for prestresses isn't needed
	  (elastic material matrix remains unchanged once initialized).
	  Once large deformation is put back in, I may need to rethink
	  this.

2005-01-18 06:14  willic3

	* [r1058] Material matrix initialization computation routine for
	  auto-computation of prestresses.

2005-01-18 06:05  willic3

	* [r1057] Updated driver routine to pass through the names of the
	  external prestress auto-computation routines.

2005-01-18 05:29  willic3

	* [r1055] New header that lists external routine names to
	  initialize the material matrix for prestress computation.

2005-01-18 05:23  willic3

	* [r1054] New driver routine to autocompute gravitational
	  prestresses. This will soon be replaced with a python equivalent.

	* [r1049] Fixed duplicate assignment of Bwork vector.

2005-01-07 03:54  willic3

	* [r1048] Corrected initial pointer for Dprev and moved it to the
	  PCG/sparse section, even though it is likely to become obsolete
	  soon.

2005-01-07 03:44  willic3

	* [r1046] Altered keyword = value files to surround all strings
	  with quotes.

	* [r1033] Added new argument to read_bc_f (numberConcForces).

2005-01-07 00:25  willic3

2005-01-07 00:06  willic3

	* [r1028] Created an information file to explain the setup of

	  routines) with PETSc routine(s).

2005-01-06 10:04  willic3

	* [r1026] Updated routine for new parsing method.

2005-01-06 09:40  willic3

	* [r1021] Altered keyword = value parsing to pass along
	  dimensional quantities rather than their values.

2005-08-23 02:15  unknown_user

	* [r1020] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2005-01-06 09:23  willic3

	* [r1019] These obsolete routines have been moved to 'unused'.

2005-01-06 09:22  willic3

	* [r1017] Moved obsolete routines to 'unused'.

2005-01-06 09:21  willic3

	* [r1015] New includes to define force flags.

2005-01-06 09:19  willic3

	* [r1013] Updated routine for new force vectors. Routine is much
	  simpler since only the concentrated force vector is needed to
	  represent nodal loads.

2005-01-06 09:15  willic3

	* [r1011] Altered routine to return an argument with the number of
	  concentrated force entries.

2005-01-06 06:48  willic3

	* [r1009] Updated routine for new force vectors. Routine is much
	  simpler since only the concentrated force vector is needed to
	  represent nodal loads.

2005-01-06 06:46  willic3

	* [r1008] Updated routine for new force vectors. Split node
	  displacement contributions are explicitly included in the
	  internal force vector (at the beginning of a step).

2005-01-06 06:44  willic3

	* [r1007] Updated routine for new force vectors. The old confusing
	  way of updating the load vector for large deformation problems
	  is no longer necessary.

2005-01-06 06:37  willic3

	* [r1006] Updated routine for new force vectors.

2005-01-06 06:35  willic3

	* [r1004] Altered routine so forces are added to the internal
	  force vector. This changes the sign of the forces.

2005-01-06 06:33  willic3

	* [r1002] Updated routine to use new force vectors.

2005-01-06 06:32  willic3

	* [r1001] Updated routine to use new force and PCG vectors.
	  Altered some initialization of vectors at the beginning of a
	  step. Nodal loads are added to the concentrated force vector
	  rather than the global load vector, making it easier to separate
	  out contributions. Winkler forces are no longer recomputed
	  (routine unlock) when a spring is locked or unlocked, since the
	  new method of putting these forces into the internal force
	  vector should make this unnecessary (this has not yet been
	  tested).

2005-01-06 06:26  willic3

	* [r999] Updated routine to use new force and PCG vectors. Current
	  method of dealing with reused solution vector is incorrect, but
	  this routine will soon be replaced by a PETSc routine anyway.

2005-01-06 06:23  willic3

	* [r998] New routine that completely reforms external force vector
	  at each iteration, then computes residual.

2005-01-06 06:22  willic3

	* [r997] Altered routine to use new force and PCG solution
	  vectors. Fixed incorrect solution option to use previous PCG
	  solution as initial guess. Other changes: bsum is now used
	  instead of bdiff. Winkler forces are now added to internal force
	  vector. External force vector is completely reformed during each
	  iteration. Internal force vector uses stresses from previous
	  step for first iteration, augmented by forces from kinematic BC.
	  For additional iterations, internal force vector corresponds to
	  current stresses.

2005-01-06 06:13  willic3

	* [r996] Changed routine and calls for new force vectors and PCG
	  solution vectors.

2005-01-06 06:10  willic3

	* [r995] Updated routine for new force vectors. Altered and
	  commented out debugging statements.

2005-01-06 06:08  willic3

	* [r994] Added build option for testing configuration. Deleted
	  bdiff.f source and replaced it with new bsum.f routine. Deleted
	  unlock.f from sources since it is not needed with the new method
	  of handling Winkler forces.

2004-11-02 04:42  willic3

	* [r992] Fixed incorrect version number to correspond to new
	  version scheme.

2004-11-02 00:21  willic3

	* [r990] Partial initial UML class diagram for new lithomop
	  structure.

2004-10-22 02:48  willic3

	* [r988] Image of what a simple 2-node split-node element might
	  look like for the case of a split fault.

2004-10-14 03:08  willic3

	* [r986] Some ideas on implementing a split-node element.

2004-10-11 22:50  willic3

	* [r984] Very rough template for creation of a Mesh object. At
	  present, this just contains some __init__ definitions.

2004-10-08 22:45  willic3

	* [r982] Initial description of proposed mesh object, along with a
	  description of how elements are presently implemented in f77.

2004-09-27 22:57  willic3

	* [r980] Pasted in a bunch of recent e-mails to myself. This list
	  will need to be thoroughly edited in the near future.

2004-09-24 00:39  willic3

	* [r978] Initial versions of code to use SimulationController.

2004-09-24 00:38  willic3

	* [r976] Initial versions of codes to use SimulationController.

2004-09-24 00:37  willic3

	* [r974] Initial versions of files to use SimulationController.

2004-09-01 02:14  willic3

	* [r973] Fixed stupid indexing problem with connectivity array.

2004-09-01 02:13  willic3

	* [r972] Commented out debugging statements.

2004-09-01 01:58  willic3

	* [r971] Fixed dimension of istatout array.

2004-08-29 22:51  willic3

	* [r969] Removed debugging statements.

2004-08-27 23:25  willic3

	* [r968] Added computation of Winkler BC based on assumed density
	  and g for simulation of gravity along specified surfaces.

2004-08-27 08:29  willic3

	* [r967] Revised code to use boundary condition codes to define
	  boundaries rather than mesh extrema.

2004-08-27 01:48  willic3

	* [r966] Changed cell types written to UCD file to conform to AVS
	  definitions, as far as possible (wricks do not correspond to any
	  AVS cell type). Quadratic element cell types are no longer
	  preceded by a 'q'. Output order of cell vertices has been
	  scrambled to correspond to AVS documentation, including midside
	  nodes. At present, it is unknown whether AVS (or other codes
	  that read UCD format) will automatically recognize midside nodes.

2004-08-27 01:10  willic3

	* [r965] Added neemax*neemax to total for iwork to prevent
	  erroneous 'not enough memory' message.

2004-08-26 04:00  willic3

	* [r963] Added new lt2qt utility.
	* [r961] New utility to generate a quadratic tet mesh from a
	  linear tet mesh by inserting new nodes.

2004-08-26 03:58  willic3

	* [r959] The old files related to the potentially bad mesh have
	  been retained to see what the problem might be. First guess is
	  duplicate nodes.

2004-08-26 03:57  willic3

	* [r957] These files have been generated using the new lt2qt
	  utility to create a quadratic tetrahedral mesh from the linear
	  tetrahedral mesh in examples/lintet/bm1a. It appears that the
	  problems with the quadratic tets may have been due to a bad mesh
	  rather than a problem with the code. The new mesh gives results
	  consistent with those of the other element types.

2004-08-26 00:04  willic3

	* [r955] Updated state variable output definitions.

2004-08-26 00:03  willic3

	* [r944] Added Make.mm for SCEC BM 1 at 1 km resolution.

2004-08-25 23:52  willic3

	* [r943] Removed additional line used to define state variable
	  output for time-dependent solution. The same information is now
	  used for both elastic and time-dependent solutions.

2004-08-25 23:47  willic3

	* [r941] Removed additional line used to define state variable
	  output for time-dependent solution. The same information is now
	  used for both elastic and time-dependent solutions.

2004-08-25 08:58  willic3

	* [r939] Removed additional line used to define state variable
	  output for time-dependent solution. The same information is now
	  used for both elastic and time-dependent solutions.

2004-08-25 08:57  willic3

	* [r937] Updated 'clean' action to remove UCD files.

2004-08-25 08:55  willic3

	* [r936] Changed routine to use new plot output options and set
	  appropriate integer variable. Updated routine for UCD output,
	  including setting integer variable, usage of write_ucd_mesh
	  routine, and passing appropriate variables. Updated routine to
	  use cmp_stiffsz routine, rather than the simple estimate of
	  working array size used previously. Included more information
	  about sparse matrix sent to stdout.

2004-08-25 08:50  willic3

	* [r935] Added to variables and inventory for usage of UCD files.
	  Updated routine for new plot output options (including none).
	  Changed default ascii output option to 'echo'.

2004-08-25 08:47  willic3

	* [r934] Updated routine to use ucdOutputRoot.

2004-08-25 08:41  willic3

	* [r933] Added entries for cmp_stiffsz and write_ucd_mesh, and
	  updated entries for elastc and viscos.

2004-08-25 08:37  willic3

	* [r931] Added bindings for cmp_stiffsz and fixed bindings for
	  lnklst.

2004-08-25 08:35  willic3

	* [r929] Added bindings for write_ucd_mesh.

2004-08-25 08:34  willic3

	* [r928] Updated bindings to include ucdOutputRoot (string).

2004-08-25 08:33  willic3

	* [r927] Added entries for cmp_stiffsz and write_ucd_mesh.

2004-08-25 08:31  willic3

	* [r925] Added kucd to units list.

2004-08-25 08:29  willic3

	* [r924] Updated routines to use kucd and ucdroot variables.

2004-08-25 08:22  willic3

	* [r923] Updated routine to use ucdroot and kucd variables and
	  fixed indexing of stmp array.

2004-08-25 08:14  willic3

	* [r921] Updated routine to use new idsk options (including no
	  plot output).

2004-08-25 08:12  willic3

	* [r919] Updated routines to use new idsk options (including no
	  plot output).

2004-08-25 07:59  willic3

	* [r918] Updated routines to use new UCD output routines, and also
	  updated to use new idsk options.

2004-08-25 07:06  willic3

	* [r917] Added entries for the new routine to estimate the
	  stiffness matrix size, as well as 3 routines used for writing
	  AVS ACD output.

2004-08-25 07:05  willic3

	* [r916] Quick and dirty routine to compute maximum number of
	  nonzero entries in the stiffness matrix. The routine does not
	  take into account multiple elements that access the same
	  entries, and therefore generally overestimates the value, which
	  is used as the size of two integer working arrays used to
	  generate the stiffness matrix structure.

2004-08-25 01:36  willic3

	* [r914] Added 'iucd' to list of print parameters.

2004-08-25 01:30  willic3

	* [r913] This is a renamed version of write_ucdmesh.f. The routine
	  has also been updated for the new usage of the idsk parameter (0
	  = no output, 1 = ascii output, and 2 = binary output).

2005-08-23 02:13  unknown_user

	* [r912] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2004-08-25 01:28  willic3

	* [r911] This routine has been renamed 'write_ucd_mesh' to be more
	  consistent with other routine names.

2004-08-24 23:48  willic3

	* [r910] Fixed dimension of istatout array.

2004-08-24 23:45  willic3

	* [r909] Eliminated last dimension of istatout array that
	  specified different state variable output options for the
	  elastic and time-dependent solutions. Now the same variables are
	  output for both solutions. This will probably avoid problems
	  with postprocessors that will likely expect the same format of
	  output for each time step.

2004-08-24 23:37  willic3

	* [r908] Initial version of routine to write state variables to
	  UCD file at each time step.

2004-08-24 02:47  willic3

	* [r907] Initial version of routine to write nodal displacements
	  to a UCD- formatted file. Routine should use a variable such as
	  idispout to determine which nodal values to output, and it
	  should probably have the ability to output element (cell-based)
	  data.

2004-08-24 01:48  willic3

	* [r906] Initial version of a routine to write UCD mesh
	  information, primarily motivated by the needs of the SCEC
	  modeling group. This routine creates two files: 1. A regular UCD
	  file containing header, coordinates, and connectivities. This
	  file is written before the solution is computed, so there are no
	  displacements or element values, although the header indicates
	  that there should be 3 nodal values per node. The nodal values
	  (displacements) are written to a separate file for each time
	  step by the routine write_ucd_node_vals. 3. Another UCD file
	  that outputs only the coordinates of the mesh Gauss points,
	  treating them as if they were nodes. No connectivities are
	  written. The header indicates the number of values to be written
	  per "node", which is determined by the entries in istatout. The
	  actual values (stresses/strains) are written to a separate file
	  for each time step by the routines write_ucd_gauss_vals.

2005-08-23 02:13  unknown_user

	* [r905] [vcp] delete of edited revision with dead state

2004-08-24 01:14  willic3

	* [r904] This file has been removed, since its only purpose was to
	  define math libraries, which are not needed at the module level.

2004-08-19 04:07  willic3

	* [r903] Commented out statement to include local.def, since math
	  libraries do not need to be linked at the module level.

2004-08-19 04:05  willic3

	* [r902] Added PROJ_LIBRARIES to linked libraries.
	* [r901] Added MATH_LIBS to PROJ_LIBRARIES so BLAS/LAPACK are
	  linked to f77 library.

2004-08-17 11:15  willic3

	* [r900] Created makefiles to clean directory of output files and
	  run SCEC BM 1.

2004-08-17 10:27  willic3

	* [r899] Modified make to include libg2c.

2004-08-17 10:26  willic3

	* [r898] Modified file so that libg2c is linked.

2004-08-17 00:35  willic3

	* [r897] Added make statements for readnetgen.

2004-08-17 00:34  willic3

	* [r896] Utility code similar to readucd to translate netgen
	  neutral format to lithomop format.

2004-08-17 00:33  willic3

	* [r894] Fixed split node output format.

2004-08-14 22:37  willic3

	* [r893] Fixed problem where unused arrays for traction BC (not
	  yet implemented) were causing an error message at the end of
	  program execution. Arrays are now allocated with dimensions of
	  zero (numberTractionBc), which solves the problem.

2004-08-13 23:42  willic3

	* [r891] Fixed precomputation of shape functions for quadratic
	  'wrick'.

2004-08-13 09:36  willic3

	* [r889] Ugly fix to force lithomop3dapp.py to be copied to
	  $EXPORT_ROOT/bin, rather than creating a symbolic link.

2004-08-13 06:38  willic3

	* [r887] Increased maximum size of error string.

2004-08-13 06:34  willic3

	* [r885] Some simple standalone utilities to go along with the
	  lithomop package. Note: ucd3d has not been update for lithomop.
	  It was written for the old standalone version of TECTON and will
	  need to be updated.

2004-08-13 06:31  willic3

	* [r883] Added files and scripts to run patch tests for quadratic
	  tets. Note: There is still a problem with the quadratic tets.

2004-08-13 06:30  willic3

	* [r881] Added files for SCEC BM 1 at 1 km resolution using
	  quadratic tets. Note: There is still a bug with the quadratic
	  tets -- the code runs, but the solution is wrong.

2004-08-13 06:04  willic3

	* [r879] Added files and scripts to perform patch tests for
	  quadratic hexes.

2004-08-13 06:03  willic3

	* [r877] Added files to describe SCEC BM 1 at 1 km resolution
	  using quadratic hexahedral elements.

2004-08-13 05:53  willic3

	* [r875] Temporarily fixed these routines to not show up as bugs.
	  Neither routine is operational yet.

2004-08-13 05:31  willic3

	* [r874] Removed files that were originally brought over from
	  pycrust. They are not updated for lithomop and have been
	  superceded by files for different element types.

2004-08-13 05:24  willic3

	* [r873] Removed initial files that were brought over from
	  pycrust. They are not up-to-date with lithomop.

2004-08-13 05:22  willic3

	* [r871] Files and scripts to run patch tests for linear tets.

2004-08-13 05:20  willic3

	  linear tets.

2004-08-13 04:55  willic3

	* [r867] Added files needed to run SCEC BM 1 at 2 km resolution.

2004-08-13 04:54  willic3

	* [r865] Added files needed to run SCEC BM 1 at 1 km resolution.

2004-08-13 04:45  willic3

	* [r863] Added scripts to run all patch tests for a variety of
	  conditions.

2004-08-13 04:44  willic3

	* [r861] Updated statevar and time files. Added keyword=value
	  files corresponding to selective (bbar) and reduced integration.
	  Added material properties file for nearly-incompressible case.
	  Added boundary conditions for all patch tests.

2004-08-13 04:09  willic3

	* [r859] Brief description of example and a note that the files
	  have not been updated for use with lithomop.

2004-08-13 03:58  willic3

	* [r857] Brief description and a note that these files have not
	  been updaed to work with lithomop.

2004-08-13 03:51  willic3

	* [r856] Added write statements to indicate when stiffness matrix
	  is being reformed.

2004-08-13 03:50  willic3

	* [r855] Added code to correctly update nrftot.

2004-08-13 03:49  willic3

	* [r853] Added experimental code to simulate a stack trace when an
	  error condition is generated in a called routine. This needs
	  more work, probably at the module level.

2004-08-13 03:47  willic3

	* [r852] Added code to properly update nrftot variable (total
	  number of stiffness reformations).

2004-08-13 03:46  willic3

	* [r851] Set up material matrix initialization in td_matinit_5 the
	  same way as for td_matinit_1. Also, removed the conditional call
	  to td_matinit_5 (for now) from td_strs_mat_5. The material
	  matrix is always recomputed if td_strs_mat_5 is called, although
	  it probably is not necessary.

2004-08-13 03:43  willic3

	* [r850] Material matrix is now zeroed at the Gauss point level
	  rather than a higher level for time-dependent matrix formation.
	  This allows some material models to keep the same matrix if it
	  is known to remain constant.

2004-08-13 03:39  willic3

	* [r849] Added write statement to indicate when stiffness matrix
	  is being reformed.
	* [r848] Added write statements to indicate when stiffness matrix
	  is being reformed.

2004-08-13 00:11  willic3

	* [r846] Improved formatting of runtime print statements.

2004-08-12 23:53  willic3

	* [r844] Fixed copyright to return correct name 'lithomop3d'
	  rather than 'testpy' name used for testing.

2004-08-12 23:52  willic3

	* [r843] Fixed incorrect name used in import statement (lithomop3d
	  rather than testpy).

2004-08-12 23:50  willic3

	* [r841] Export statement has been changed from
	  export-python-modules to export-package-python-modules.

2004-08-12 23:49  willic3

	* [r839] The materialModel is now 5 rather than 4, to save slots
	  for additional elastic models.

2004-08-12 23:47  willic3

	* [r837] Changed variable name from numberMaterialProperties to
	  numberProperties to correspond to name of global variable.
	  Commented out debugging statements.

2004-08-12 23:44  willic3

	  definition. Debugging statements have been commented out.

2004-08-12 23:40  willic3

	* [r835] Primary changes include tracking f77 memory usage and
	  outputting an approximate value in MB.

2004-08-12 23:32  willic3

	* [r834] Significant modifications, some as a result of debugging
	  and some due to refinement and additions of features. Major
	  changes: Removed unnecessary imports. Added tracking of f77
	  memory usage. Removed (at least temporarily) try/except blocks
	  so that all exceptions are caught by top-level python. Sent
	  integer quadrature order parameter to write_element_info for
	  output. Numerous commented-out debugging statements. Now use
	  integer parameter to determine auto rotation of slippery nodes.
	  Increased (greatly) the size of the sparse matrix working array
	  due to difficulties encountered with quadratic hexes.

2004-08-12 23:04  willic3

	* [r833] Significant modifications since previous version. Some
	  are a result of debugging, some are refinement or additions of
	  features. Major changes: Changed methods of importing
	  module/packages. Added parameters to track f77 memory usage.
	  Made sure all integer parameters set in f77 routines are now
	  returned in lists. Fixed implementation of keyword=value
	  parsing. Fixed some problems where I was missing the leading
	  underscore for some variables. Removed (at least temporarily)
	  try/except block so all exceptions are now caught by top-level
	  python. Added and made use of some new variables related to
	  material properties and connectivities. Fixed calls to winkler
	  scanning routines so all integer parameters are returned in a
	  list.

2004-08-12 22:18  willic3

	* [r832] Added code to handle cases where the value might be a
	  string rather than a numeric or boolean value.

2004-08-12 22:12  willic3

	* [r831] Routine now contains commented-out debugging statements.
	  Routine makemsr now uses workingArraySize as the value to use
	  for journal.

2004-08-12 22:08  willic3

	* [r829] Fixed scan_wink and scan_winkx to return all results in a
	  list using Py_BuildValue.

2004-08-12 22:01  willic3

	* [r827] These files used for testing and editing purposes have
	  been moved to 'unused' to keep them out of the way.

2004-08-12 21:41  willic3

	* [r825] These drivers to test the lnklst and makemsr routines
	  have been moved to 'unused'.

2004-08-12 21:40  willic3

	* [r823] This version of the lnklst routine has been moved to
	  'unused' for reference.

2004-08-12 21:39  willic3

	* [r821] These versions of the pquadtet routine have been moved
	  into 'testdir' for evaluation and reference.

2004-08-12 09:36  willic3

	* [r820] Fixed line where state was being output rather than
	  dstate.

	  updates into fewer calls to daxpy.

2004-08-12 09:31  willic3

	* [r817] Modified routine to accept nstate and rgiter and pass
	  those along with rtimdat and ntimdat to the
	  material-model-specific material matrix initialization routine.
	  Routine now contains commented-out debugging statements.

2004-08-12 09:27  willic3

	  for elements with imatvar=0. Routine now contains commented-out
	  debugging statements.

2004-08-12 09:22  willic3

	* [r809] Checking in this version of presurql, even though it is
	  not presently functional. It is now a placeholder for a more
	  generic routine for computation of traction BC.

2004-08-12 09:19  willic3

	* [r807] Checking in this version of pquadtet, although there
	  still appear to be some problems with quadratic tets. Reordered
	  local coordinates to be consistent with right-handed tet.
	  Reordered midside node shape functions to be consistent with web
	  resource. Each function and its local coordinate derivatives are
	  defined separately rather than within a loop.

2004-08-12 09:14  willic3

	* [r805] Removed old commented-out code that was incorrectly
	  computing shape function info.

2004-08-12 09:12  willic3

	* [r803] Routine now contains commented-out debugging statements.

2004-08-12 09:11  willic3

	  coordinate is listed first).

2004-08-12 09:09  willic3

	* [r799] Routine now contains commented-out debugging statements.

2004-08-12 09:08  willic3

	* [r796] Modified argument lists for inclusion of rgiter and
	  nstate. Commented out line where dmat was improperly being
	  cleared (it should only be cleared at the beginning of the
	  elastic solution and is now cleared in elastc). Routine now
	  contains commented-out debugging statements.

2004-08-12 09:03  willic3

	* [r794] Routine now contains commented-out debugging statements.
	* [r793] Added type and definition statements to td_matinit_1 for
	  rtimdat, rgiter, and ntimdat.

2004-08-12 09:01  willic3

	  stress computation. Improved ascii output for material property
	  info. Routine now contains commented-out debugging statements.

2004-08-12 08:59  willic3

	* [r791] Improved ascii output of material property info. Added
	  type and definition statements to td_matinit_1 for rtimdat,
	  rgiter, and ntimdat.

2004-08-12 08:54  willic3

	* [r789] Fixed incorrect computation of the minimum nonzero terms
	  per row. Routine now contains commented-out debugging statements.

	  Routine now contains commented-out debugging statements.

2004-08-12 08:39  willic3

	* [r784] Updated subroutine argument lists. Routine now contains
	  commented-out debugging statements.

2004-08-12 08:34  willic3
