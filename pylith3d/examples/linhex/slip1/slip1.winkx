# Input format:
#
#  n:       node number
#  iwinkx:  application mode for each degree of freedom:
#           0  = no Winkler force
#           1  = Winkler force applied at all times
#           -n = Winkler force applied according to load history n.
#  winkx:   magnitude of restoring force for each degree of freedom
#
# n    (iwinkx(i),i=1,ndof)  (winkx(i),i=1,ndof)
