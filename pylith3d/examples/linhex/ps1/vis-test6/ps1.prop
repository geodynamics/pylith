#  Sample material properties definition file.
#  The number of properties for each material model have been
#  previously defined.
#  At present, the materials are assumed to be listed in order, so that
#  material number is determined by position in this file.  This may
#  change in the future.
#  Also, the end of each material description is signified by setting
#  the endMaterial flag to 'True'.
#  Also at present, the materialType corresponds to a class, so the
#  first letter is capitalized.
