This is a set of simple tests of the automatic computation of 
initial stresses for problems with gravity.  This set of examples is
primarily for the purpose of testing the implementation, but anyone
wishing to try these tests can run them all by simply typing 'mm'.
Note that each test runs for 100 time steps, so they will take a while
to run.
