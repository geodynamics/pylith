This is meant to be a very simple test of all the viscoelastic models
presently available.  The default model is a linear Maxwell viscoelastic
model, which is obtained by simply typing 'pylith3dapp.py' in this
directory.  Additional models can be used by typing:
'pylith3dapp.py xxx.cfg'
where xxx is the name of the desired model (just look at the names of
the xxx.cfg files in this directory).

Notice that the nonlinear models (power-law) make use of a different
time stepping description file designed for nonlinear material models.
