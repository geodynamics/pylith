1.  Split viscos into applyBC and advance and output to conform to Solver.
    Possibly for future:
    Possible do the same thing to elastc so they can be used in the same way.
    The solver could have an elastic facility and a viscous facility.
2.  Fix elastc so it doesn't do any output itself.  Note:  output all the same
things for both elastic and time-dependent (fix statevar).
3.  Lithomop3d_run will disappear.  Instead, I'll have solver_elastc and
solver_const.  

First thing to do:  write Mesh.py and see if Brad thinks it makes sense.
If so, then start making other objects (e.g., Materials, etc.)

Change looping in element routines to loop over material model rather than type.

Change indexing to sort elements by model rather than type.
