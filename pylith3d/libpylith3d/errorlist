#  Temporary (soon-to-be-revised) list of error codes so far.
#  These need to be divided into different exception categories.
#
#  Tentative categories:
#  1-99:	I/O errors
#  100-199:	Invalid values
#  200-299:	Arithmetic errors
#  negative:	Invalid jacobian
#  300-399:	Memory errors
#  400-499:     Runtime errors
#
